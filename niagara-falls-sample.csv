If that's you, ask first.  The room and bathroom are smallish, so if you are of considerable bulk, it might be a bit tight.  Comfortable bed with enough bedding and pillows, large closet space, enough room in the dresser.  Small fridge in the room with two bottles of water already chilled -- nice!  Everything was clean and tidy throughout.  As for breakfast -- warning -- don't fill your plate with the first offering!  Fred just kept bringing platters out from the kitchen -- I'd already taken some French toast, and then he brought out sausages, two kinds of eggs, fruit, vegetables (some right out of their garden) (one platter hot, one platter cold), cheese... \""Fred, STOP!!\""   Plus there was yogurt in the dining room fridge, and cold cereal and toast available, too, along with coffee, tea, orange juice, milk.  So much lovely food, simply prepared and arrayed, and delicious.  Great way to fill up for a busy day ahead!  They were very helpful in directing us to places to see in the area (Niagara-on-the-Lake is worth the lovely drive; what a delightful town!  Oh, the flowers...).  The falls are within walking distance (if you're used to walking), and you really shouldn't miss seeing them at night with the lights on the water.

The hosts are very eager to please in any way.  They ask their guests if they should go into the room to tidy up or whatever, they don't just go in.  They feel that's not appropriate, so if you want them to go into your room, let them know.   While it's not a \""park your car when you arrive and don't get into it again until you leave\"" kind of area, we enjoyed walking in the area and felt totally safe doing so at night.  There's a gazebo out in the back where we spent an hour one lazy afternoon; that would be a great place to relax with wine and some snacks in the evening.  One thing that freaked us out is that the sun rises earlier and sets later than we were used to!

We had a very spacious living\u002F dining\u002F full kitchen area with a lovely balcony where we sat in the evening to relax. The most amazing and wonderful surprise is the fabulous HUGE breakfast delivered every morning by Fred straight to our apartment. \nWhat a wonderful way to start the day. The house is very close to everything but in a lovely quiet part of town. Nice to come back to after a busy day in the Falls area with all the crowds. The house faces a small park.\nWe always try and stay in b&b when we travel and rank this one up at the top.\nA big \""Thank you\"" to Emina and Fred for a most wonderful and pleasant stay\nWe give it this place 4 star!s and highly recommend it to those looking for a truly comfortable, convenient \"" home away from home\"" environment. \nJody and Bill\nSteve and Marilyn",5,positive,"October 21, 2017",8006 Norton St,Niagara Falls,Ontario,L2G 6R9

However there were several inconsistencies between the booking and what we actually got. \n\nThe Good:\nThe best asset of this B & B is its proximity to the falls without being in the busy commercial district where the majority of the hotels are located. The building is only three blocks from the American Falls and is within walking distance to all the main attractions. Also it is set in a nice neighborhood that is much quieter than the hustle and bustle ever where else. \n\nEven though we visited during a \""peak\"" weekend, the B & B was quiet and not to many people were staying at it. This made breakfast enjoyable as we weren't having to talk over a bunch of people. As well as made the B & B more quiet as people didn't keep coming in and out. \n\nThe host \u002F owner (Susan) was very helpful and friendly. She met us right away and check in was quite easy. Also, she was able to direct us to popular attractions and help us locate different destinations.\n\nOverall this was a great experience and we would visit again.\n\nThe Bad:\nFirst - Trip Advisor and Hotels-com (where we booked the room) shows a picture of a nice brick building, with a deck and veranda overlooking the front yard. THIS IS NOT the same B & B. Instead it is a building that is fairly plain looking, no decks or porches on the front and a tight narrow driveway that would cause parking to be an issue if the B & B was at full capacity. \n\nWe stayed in a \""Premium\"" suite which had a two person jacuzzi and gas fireplace. The room was nice, and for the most part clean. However the mirror over the couch in the bedroom was streaked and looked dirty. Also, the doors that separated the front room from the main room was missing a pane of glass. There was an ugly and uncomfortable carpet in front of the bed, which was unpleasant to walk on in bare feet, when I went to move it I realized it was their to cover up a stain on the actual carpet. (I'm fine with covering up a spot, but at least use a nice throw rug). The gas fireplace didn't seam to work, we could get it to ignite, but it wouldn't stay on. This may have been operator error (our fault), however it would have been nice to have a set of directions explaining how to use it. Also, our room was on the first floor, and the walls were somewhat thin.

data/ca/154998/456993/227825388.html,Villa Alexandrea Bed &amp; Breakfast,"""My boyfriend and I have a fairly general rule that when using sites like Tripadviser and Yelp, that one or two bad reviews is almost NEVER representative of the true experience one is going to have so it's generally unfair to base ones decision to stay at a property (or not to for that matter) when these types of reviews in small quantity make an appearance and we, with virtually zero exceptions until now, have always found that everyone has a a bad experience somewhere and that the squeaky wheel always gets the grease. So when we saw the review for Villa Alexandrea that mentioned a rude host and then considered the proximity of the property to the Falls, the main Niagara attractions, and the pictures of the property itself, we employed this theory and said, \""One bad apple surely can't ruin the bunch.\"" \n\nHow wrong we were. I've never in my adult life felt less welcomed, been treated with such disdain and apathy, and above all, been so disappointed in money spent compared to services received. Our \""host\"", the owner Maria, began our experience by denying us a late check out from 11am to 12pm (which in an of itself is perfectly fine - not every property, especially popular ones, can accommodate such requests but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't shocked that there appears to be zero buffer between a guest checking out and a guest checking in at Villa Alexandrea which is demonstrative of plain old poor planning and a concern for packing in as many guests as possible rather than making the experience for each guest a unique and special one) and then scolded my boyfriend when he called to say that his travels from Brooklyn NY (and my own from Washington DC) were going cause us to be rather late. Maria's response that she \""needed to get some sleep\"" because she was cooking breakfast for the 8 guests on property was a shocking one - we stay almost exclusively at BnB's and have NEVER been given a hard time about late check ins let alone scolded like children for keeping the host up \""past her bedtime\"" when she easily could have tapes our key to the front door and called it a night. Maria did call back and change her tune somewhat but let's just say that with the bad reviews lingering in our minds and the tone and treatment we were receiving before even checking in being as they were, the well had already been poisoned. \n\nOur experience was further ruined - yes, *ruined* - when we arrived for breakfast the next morning earlier than Maria had dictated to my boyfriend at Check-In (yet another red flag - My boyfriend was told we may sit for breakfast at 930am without any inquiry by our \""host\"" (and yes, there's a reason I continue to use quotes because this woman was as far from a true host as one can possibly be) as to our plans for the day, what time we might be heading out for some planned adventure or similar and with zero care or concern for her adamant refusal that we be afforded a later checkout, meaning our breakfast would be served to is 1.5hrs prior to our demanded departure from the property. I've never been \""assigned\"" a time to attend breakfast at a BnB nor would I expect to. The beauty of this type of lodging is two fold: that your breakfast is both homemade and a part of your expense but also that if the signage and paperwork dictates that breakfast is served between, say 830am to 1030am, one can choose the time that serves their daily touring plans best without having to forego or worse, lose time outside the property waiting for ones breakfast \""time\"" to arrive). I was pleased to have the experience of eating breakfast family style with other guests and Maria is clearly an accomplished cook but a few things about the meal were disturbing: there was a clear fruit fly problem in the kitchen and dining area and thus, the orange juice pitcher and our food were frequently the landing zones for these pests which was, to say the least. Furthermore, I made the distinct mistake of asking our \""host\"" if when making our breakfast (she was at the time asking us how we preferred our eggs prepared) she could cook my bacon well down because I have a hard time stomaching the texture of less-than-crispy bacon and I was informed curtly that the bacon has already been made. My question was not answered mind you - I was simply told in not so many words that my request was not possible (or reasonable for that matter) because she had already made the food and was not willing to prepare it again in a manner that I, the guest, found appetizing. You can imagine my great shock and ironic laughter when as we were leaving our fruit fly infested dining table, Maria announced she had two pounds of bacon left and would any of us like her to cook some more for us to eat. It was like watching a bad production of A Comedy of Errors and having been cast in the starring roles without so much as an audition. \n\nFinally, as we races back to our room to prepare to leave since it was again made clear to us that we were expected to vacate our room no later than 11am, we discovered how serious our \""host\"" was when she sent her housekeeper to our room to strip the bed and collect our use towels mere *minutes* after 11am and scolded again, this time by the housekeeper. I managed to remove all our luggage and items into the hallway to finish organizing and preparing for departure but was forced to use a public restroom to brush my teeth because I was not afforded time to do so in our room's private bathroom. \n\nOverall, it likely goes without saying that our experience at Villa Alexandrea, a property that by all accounts is stunning to look at and maintained at a level of cleanliness that was appropriate and acceptable, was sadly one of the most disappointing and wholly underwhelming bed and breakfast experiences we have ever had. I desperately want to say something positive because on the whole, I find negative reviews such as these to be ignoring so many of the positives that many properties exhibit but which are ignored when something happens that colors the stay in a less than pleasant color for the guest. Sadly, I simply cannot find one positive attribute to speak of here other than the: 1. Proximity to the Falls and downtown; 2. The cleanliness of our room (though the sheets and towels while clean had clearly seen better days); and lastly, 3. The scrambled eggs our \""host\"" made were some of the best I've enjoyed in a long time, fruit flies notwithstanding. Unfortunately, however, that's ALL I can say about this property that ranks in the \""positives\"" column and in fact, despite that we felt we had paid a decent rate for our room, if someone were to tell me I had won a free weekend at Villa Alexandrea, there's almost a 100% likelihood that I would decline to stay there, even for free. \n\nOur \""host\"" really could use a lesson in good old fashioned hospitality - we weren't expecting the red carpet to be rolled out for our arrival nor to be treated like royalty. We WERE expecting to be treated like valued and welcomed guests, in whom our \""host\"" took a sincere interest in helping to make our visit to Niagara Falls the best it could be, and who had a genuine air of gratitude towards us for choosing her property. Instead we received rudeness, attitude that made us feel more like a nuisance than welcomed guests, and treatment that ruined the beginning of our one day visit to\nNiagara Falls. \n\nAs a result, not only can I not recommend Villa Alexandrea as a bed and breakfast worth booking and spending one's money at but instead caution you as travelers to not make the same mistake my boyfriend and I did: it is true that one or two bad reviews of a property or restaurant are not representative fully of where you're headed but I can assure you that from now on, we will absolutely do a little more research into the negatives before brushing them aside as the rantings of a high maintenance guest who simply cannot be pleased. My boyfriend and I are likely two of the easiest going travelers that exist but we will never again view the negative reviews of a property in the same light after experiencing the beyond disappointing treatment we received at Villa Alexandrea and its \""host\"", Maria.",1,negative,"September 8, 2014",5287 River Rd,Niagara Falls,Ontario,L2E 3G9

Either way, though, they made sure you had plenty to choose from and didn't walk away hungry. \n\nThe bad: We didn't get to stay in the room that I'm pretty sure I reserved. We were moved to the Loft, which was a nice gesture since it was bigger, but it had a strong mildew smell. The bathroom, in particular, was quite strong. We asked if there was another room available, and we were moved to the Rose room. The smell wasn't nearly as bad in that one, so we finished out our stay in that room. However, the room - and house in general, I think - seemed to stay very damp. The outside of the house was beautiful, but the inside could definitely use some updates. Our room had a claw foot tub in the bathroom - which was nice - but it had an impossible shower curtain lining the inside of it. We are on the smaller side, and every time one of us took a shower, it was a battle with the shower curtain, because it would stick to you while you were trying to bathe. It had to stay inside the tub at all times, though, to keep from damaging the floor or walls elsewhere with water. Taking a shower with it sticking to you is not pleasant at all, and I definitely didn't feel clean afterwards.

Since going outside of the country is not a smart option, we opted to stay close to home.  We've chosen a Marriot property over the others due to the solid reputation and the fact that I am a loyal Marriot Bonvoy member, so as I thought.  Also, during time of Covid, we thought more protocols and safety measure would be put in place for a brand-named property such as Marriot on the falls. \n\nNeedless to say, we were both quite disappointed of how little safety measure were put in place at the lobby. On one  evening , out of the 3 elevators that can go up to our floor, 1 was down, leaving 2 left.  The elevators also were slow which caused long line up for guests to wait their turn to get in one of the 2 elevators. There were virtually no signs on the floor to indicate the 2 meter social distance requirement.  There was also no signs that indicate the maximum capacity per each elevator unit (the only sign we saw was on our floor which stated 3 was the max). There were no staff there to help organize the lineup and to explain the situations although concierge desk is right next to the elevators. Many guests were confused as to why they had to wait 20 minutes for elevators.  This caused crowding and little to no social distancing which was a huge Covid hazard.  The concierge also did not explicitly inform the guests upon check in of the max elevator capacity, which we believe should be something clearly told and signs should be put in visible places.   The only Covid related instruction given to us upon check-in was that there is no longer room cleaning which is understandable.\n\nDuring our elevator trip up (which was meant to be a short trip up to grab a sweater before going out again, and we ended up just staying in due to the elevator stress), although we told other guests that maximum capacity should be 3 if they are not from the same family, no one listened and people rushed in. We ended up having 8 strangers in the elevator unit.  This is a clear indication of inadequate information given to the guests.   There was also a McDonald's delivery person in our elevator. When I emailed the hotel about restrictions on non-guest visits and allowing delivery people to freely come in and out, the hotel only reluctantly replied that Marriot relies on food service company's protocols and background check.  That's absurd. How can you rely on someone else's policy (which also had nothing to do with Covid) on your own property?\n \nI am sure that the hotel is aware of how slow the elevators are and so if one is down, there is bound to be a long line up. The next morning on our way down, we waited 10 minutes for the elevator to arrive. And luckily we were on a higher floor and the elevator only had one other passenger. The elevator then stopped at every single floor along the way until it reached the ground floor and there were 9 passengers at the end. I understand that elevator breakdowns can be \u201Cunforeseen\u201D  per the hotel staff but managing the guests is not. Promoting social responsibility in preventing the spread of COVID-19 should also be part of your property\u2019s mandate. \n\nAC fan were extremely loud. And it\u2019s on and off every 10 minutes which made it hard to sleep at night.\n\nIn short, although we understand strict measures could be difficult at a tourist location, I believe more could be done in this regard to make your guests  feel comfortable staying.

Jasleen at front desk was amazing, and it's because of her we truly got to enjoy Niagara Falls!\n\nThe only downsides I have were parking, and that we got moved to a room that smelled like smoke.\n\nThe parking lot is not as big as it should be for the size of this hotel. There were no spots left after we got back from Clifton Hill at around 10-11 PM. Niagara Falls is a tourist city, but I did not expect parking to be so hectic.\n\nAdditionally, we got moved from a lovely king suite on the 20th floor, down to the 18th for three days. Everything was perfect until the bathroom started to smell like smoke during my shower. I knew it right away as I grew up with a parent that smoked. I had to get housekeeping to spray it with freshener numerous times, but the smell would eventually come back and linger. I don't know if this was from a previous guest or if the ventilation fans are connected to other rooms. As a former housekeeper, I know guests tend to rebel when it comes to rules against smoking. It was very unfortunate, and it slightly ruined my experience because I'm extremely sensitive to the awful smell.\n\nOther than that, I highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Niagara Falls.

I kept getting different staff delivering a coffee machine twice before finally getting the kettle.\nc) chair in room was stained and dirty. The staff were quick to respond by attempting to clean it but I asked for it to be removed and that was done promptly. \nd) the worst one: someone else's hair all over the bathroom floor. The reason I didn't inform room service to come and clean is because i had spent a hefty amount of time (obv before noticing the hair) sanitizing the room with Lysol and i didn't want to have to do it all over again after having room service in the room.\n\nNonetheless, the staff around the hotel are friendly and hard working.

We were driving ahead of a snowstorm, and were able to change our nonrefundable reservation on-line so that we checked in and out one day early.  When we arrived that evening, the hotel's computer hadn't made note of that change, but the desk clerk handled it all well and got us in to our room after a short delay.\n\nWith that short notice change, we wouldn't have really expected an upgrade due to my wife's Platinum status, yet the desk clerk stated we were still upgraded, to a Falls-view room.  The room was on the third floor, where the rooms share a large balcony (designed this way for larger groups).  You could see the Falls from the edge of the icy balcony, but not from the room because the room is set back from the edge of the balcony so far.  That didn't really bother us, mostly because we were in late and out early the next morning.  What bothered us was that we entered a completely unsecured room - the sliding glass door out to the large shared balcony was unlocked and open, and the door handle was semi-broken.  What a mess - it felt more like a 1970s Travelodge.  We did nicely mention that issue to the desk clerk while departing the hotel the next morning, and we suspect that's why the overpriced parking charge was removed from the final bill, though that was never explained to us.\n\nWe grabbed a drink at the lobby bar soon after our 11pm check-in, but ended up enjoying the drink in our room because there were too many drunk \u002F obnoxious patrons in the bar.  Not unexpected given the time of day and the fact there were conferences \u002F conventions in the hotel, but not particularly well-managed either.  Breakfast the next morning was delicious -  buffet style in the restaurant overlooking the Falls, but again, located where you can't really actually see the Falls.\n\nGlad the Falls wasn't the reason we stayed here.

However, not only does this spectacular region has much more to offer than the famous views, but this jewel of a B&B alone is reason to return. \nOur stay felt like a visit to old friends.

We are USA citizens. I immediately called Lion's Head to let them know that we couldn't make it up there and said we needed to cancel. She, the owner, told me that we could not cancel and would be charged the full amount. She actually charged us after the call, before we were supposed to even arrive. Getting home, we asked our credit card company to dispute it. We lost due to the cancellation policy. Now I understand the need for policies. It's a loss of money to them. That said, sometimes 'things' happen. In our case, a fire in which we lost everything...including $850.43 that Lion's Head charged us. My point: Be careful when you book anywhere. Lion's Head could have been charitable and charged us nothing, or one night. Lion's Head told me that we had to call Booking.com b\u002Fc they collected the money.

She mentioned parking and charged me for it and because I stay at various hotels I said don\u2019t you need my license plate in which she said yes I forgot. \n\nAfter we paid, no other instructions were given to us by staff and we were about to enter into the elevator when we realized we didn\u2019t get our corporate perks which includes dine in cards etc. \n\nWhen we went back to the front desk the person didn\u2019t know what I was talking about and herself and another staff member went to see the manager even though the booking was correctly identified on your system. They came back and said we were right and pulled them out of some safe.\n\nWe found it strange as we stayed for 2 nights and only got one package... it didn\u2019t say on the Fallsview website that it is only one package for the entire stay... their need a to be more clarity on the Skyline Hotel website as I found it was not clear. I also had to mention the Wego Bus cards and other perks that came with the fee we paid at the hotel... why were the staff going to let us walk away, if I didn\u2019t ask we would not have known and received nothing.\n\nThe package we received was completely useless. We wanted to dine in at Fallsview Buffet only to find out it was closed due to COVID. It\u2019s fine that it\u2019s closed but you had 4 months to create a dynamic plan and it appears from the customers point of view that nothing was done. \n\nThe rest of the coupon package was completely useless as we had to spend 40 dollars to get a 10 dollar discount.... why even provide these coupons??? It didn\u2019t help at all as drinks are not included and you have to order 40 dollars worth of food. \n-We ordered food and drinks at the Hard Rock Cafe near the hotel only to find out after spending 80 dollars that it didn\u2019t include drinks... The server pointed out food on the back of the card in which I told her that it does not say food only excluding drinks... terrible marketing coupon... I wouldn\u2019t attach that coupon to any of your promo.\n\nThe hotel seemed run down. It needs upgrades, fresh coat of paint, appearance of elevator looked like a docking elevator from a warehouse and elevator signage was false advertising as we didn\u2019t get the 5 dollar Starbucks card for going green and keeping our towels. \n\nThe 2 atrium spaces are completely useless, I would recommend installing an indoor pool in case guests don\u2019t want to go to the water park for the future.\n\nFront desk area needs some upgrades as well, new front desk perhaps better counter tops and bring things up to todays standard around the lobby area. \n\nDoors to the hotel need updates as well, the locks to the doors don\u2019t work well with key card. It was not just me, I helped 2 other guests open the door to their rooms. \n\nWe asked for a quiet room as well, and knew guest turn out was low due to reopening, and they put two families with young kids beside us and we couldn\u2019t sleep... we mentioned this to front desk and nothing could be done... great problem solving skills.\n\nNow our room: It felt out of date for being a main attraction for the water park. It also felt like rooms were not sanitized since the time the hotel closed. Towels felt rough like sand paper. We had half a roll of toilet paper in our room and nobody explained to us as we stayed for 2 nights that cleaning staff are not going to clean or stock our room. I asked front desk to bring me toilet paper and due to COVID they asked me to go to front desk to get some. That was our second night and we were shocked nothing was cleaned in our room or our bed sheets were not changed and made... unbelievable. The staff told us all this on our second night. I would recommend a COVID information sheet provided to customers about processes at hotel. At least fill up supplies like toilet paper, I was embarrassed going down to front desk to get some, totally unacceptable to say the least... A recommend is how about dropping at front door and knocking and leaving... it\u2019s a no brainer you can\u2019t get COVID that way. \n\nInvest in new beds, the beds you have are terrible... We never slept in such poor beds that felt hard, rough and lumpy. We did not sleep well for the 2 nights. \n\nThis hotel felt like a one star. I would seriously ask three of your directors to walk around that hotel with a note pad and tell me if an average class citizen was to stay at this hotel what would they think and start walking around the hotel from there.\n\nCheers!

Mr. Wei is such a genuinely kind person. He gave me a lovely tour and I was instantly charmed by the place. I stayed in the Victorian room. It's on the ground floor. In the room, there's also a door that leads onto the porch, and the back yard...complete with a lovely little waterfall that leads into the koi pond. I slept so well that night, (and the next 2) as the bed was comfy memory foam. \n\nTransportation is easy, as there's a terrific bus that takes tourists to specific stops with the sights, and it's called WeGo bus. The stop (called the B&B Stop\u002Fand it's the green line) is steps away and around the corner from Blue Gables, and you can buy the bus tickets or adventure passes \n2 doors down at the Always Inn B&B from John or Chris, the owners.\n\nBreakfast at Blue Gables is from 9:00-10:00am, and it's delicious...with every day being different. If you'd care for coffee or tea before that, you can go to the upstairs little lounge bar with 2 bar stools, a fridge, coffee maker, cups, silverware...and make coffee at any time, or store your own food. \n\nBreakfast my first morning, was coffee, orange juice, yogurt, with fresh fruit prettily presented on top, and fresh fruit on the bottom, and after that was cleared away...a fresh fruit plate with strawberries, kiwi, pineapple, raspberries, banana, with a delicious ham, egg and cheese breakfast sandwich perfectly grilled. My second day breakfast was yogurt with fruit, and fresh fruit plate with a type of sausage, fried egg, french toast, and of course OJ and coffee, and the third morning was blueberry pancakes, sausage links, a fried egg, fresh fruit etc..\nMr. Wei had asked me the night before when I needed to catch my train in the morning.  I told him 10:15a and he said I'd need to be there at 9:50a. Then he said \""I will drive you\"" to which I replied \""But how can you drive me if you're by yourself, in the middle of breakfast? It's okay, I can take a taxi.\"" He said \""Don't worry, I've asked my sister to help me tomorrow, and I can take you.\"" So fast forward to the morning, and lo and behold, I met Sara...Wei's sister. She's just as lovely as he is. She also speaks French, and is a retired French teacher. \nAfter seeing he had help, I accepted his offer, and he also took me to the store to buy food for my 10 hour train ride back to NYC. As he was dropping me off I realized I'd forgotten to get a photo of the front of Blue Gables. I asked Mr Wei if he would please have someone take his photo in front of the house and text it to me so I can post it. He obliged. \n\nI'll  always look back fondly, on this first solo trip in 11 years, and the beginning of the next chapter of my life. It was the perfect start for my grand adventure...\nThank you Mr. Wei...I hope to see you again soon!",5,positive,"October 15, 2018",4305 Simcoe St,Niagara Falls,Ontario,L2E 1T5

Upon arrival we did no get greeted, or informed that there was a charge for parking. Before dinner we decided to shower, the shower would not drain! The hotel is very outdated and the bathroom mirror is outside of the bathroom and very dark with little lighting. The TV signal is atrocious and super blurry so we could not relax and watch a movie. The pillow case had mascara and makeup on it from the previous guest. For a Courtyard I was not impressed. The only perk was breakfast the next morning, the gentleman at the omelette station was super kind and welcoming.

The hotel was clean and comfortable, with the rooms large and spacious.  The hotel is in a great location; far enough away from the Clifton hill busy people traffic but close enough to walk to everything.  The staff are very professional, but not very friendly.  I should clarify, there was nothing wrong they were all very business level professional, I am just used to the Marriott standard of very friendly and welcoming staff and this location did not have that.   I checked to see if there was a possibility to upgrade to a room with a fireplace and it was an additional $40 a night. I did not upgrade, however they did put me in one of the better located rooms in my category, so thank you for that.  After the first night, I wanted to see about adding a package rate to the second night and I was told it was an extra $59 (for two $12 breakfasts and a $30 dinner voucher) even though when I checked the member rate online is should have been an extra $39. I asked about the difference in cost and they could not tell me so I did not add it on. There did not seem to be any benefit to being a Bonvoy member at this hotel that I noticed and no difference for members or non-members in rate or service, and the staff really do not go the extra mile to try and help.  Make sure you check your bill check you check out \u2013 there was a nightly tax that was just identified as \u201Clocal fee\u201D in additional to the other taxes.  When I asked about it I was told it was hotel tax.  When pushed a little more to see what the tax was for I was told it was an optional tax that the hotel adds \u2013 no reason for it.  I asked them to remove it and they did.  I would have been paying and extra $20 of sneaky tax for no reason.  To me this is completely unethical and I am not sure if this is a hotel practice or Marriott practice, but either way it need to be revised.  If you are going to keep the sneaky optional tax then it should be clearly identified that it is an OPTIONAL tax.",3,negative,"December 29, 2019",5950 Victoria Ave,Niagara Falls,Ontario,L2G 3L7

I booked directly through the Marriott site, I am a Bonvoy member (not tonnes of points but a fair number) and mentioned in the comments the reason for our stay. I booked a package that included a dinner voucher, wine or champagne and chocolate truffles (which were supposed to be delivered to room after we checked in). \n\nWe arrived at 2pm. To say the person checking us in was disinterested would be an understatement. One thing I really like about Marriott is they almost always thank you for being a member and if there are rooms available...upgrade members to better rooms. No thank you. When I asked about the room type the desk person sighed and said you booked a standard king room. I had sent my husband out to the car to put the parking slip in the windshield so I just flat out told the guy...I am a bonvoy member, I booked this as a surprise for my husband, might it be possible to upgrade the room if you aren't full? He sighed again...typed on the computer for a bit and said fine I can upgrade you. The wine and chocolate truffles...he went into a back room and brought out a plastic wrapped bottle of wine and two glasses with a few hershey kisses in it. Not exactly what I imagined for wine\u002Ftruffles being delivered to our room (seemed more romantic in writing..lol). Plus the hershey kisses had clearly been in there a LONG time and were totally inedible (white and chalky on the inside). \n\nI felt like the attendant was annoyed that I asked for an upgrade and he gave us no information about the hotel (where the pool was, when it was open, breakfast etc. )\n\nPast the whole lack of welcome\u002Fslight false advertising on the package issues...we did really like the hotel. The upgraded room was very large, comfy bed. The TV was small and didn't get many channels clearly but wasn't a huge deal. Great location...easy walking distances to many attractions.

Val's breakfast was hearty and tasty, primarily consisting of eggs, bacon, juice, coffee, breads, and beans.  It wasn't fancy, but was very satisfying, and was a great way to start a busy day.  We walked to the falls area, and spent half the day there before leaving the area.  Tom told us not to worry about moving our car until we were ready to go.

Had to prove to them that I was not mistaken and did properly book for 2 nights by provinding them the confirmation i had received by email when doing it over the phone.

Told me it was not a problem and they would only request a 200$ cash deposit for the 2 nights but did have to give my credit card info over the phone just to reserve it. Well surprise.

This is our report.\n\nLOCATION:\nThe hotel is very easy to find. It is in a great location at the end of Fallsview Blvd, so a bit more quiet. Note that there is another Marriott right across the street as well, so if you want a true FALLS view from your room, stay at this property.\n\nThis hotel is within easy walking distance to a number of bars, coffee shops and restaurants. Very close by you'll find the Keg and a number of other popular spots like Turtle Jack's, an Argentenian restaurant and quite a few Italian restaurants. There is more than enough choice. There is also a steakhouse (Morton's) right in the Marriott itself. There is also a Starbucks right in the hotel lobby. \n\nCHECK IN:\nNote that upon entering the hotel, you must wear a mask. \n\nCheck in was smooth and seamless! We were actually there early and our room was ready. We had a lovely Falls View on the 26th floor. See attached photos. Can't beat it. \n\nROOM:\nThe room was a decent size, but we were a tad disappointed that there were some old stains on the rug and the desk table had some greasy fingerprint marks on it. We always take our own Clorox or Lysol wipes when we travel anyway (no matter where we go), so we just whipped those out and did a quick clean of the place. (Helpful traveler hint: always wipe down your TV converter too! ) \n\nWhen we were there, the room did not have a coffee maker, which was disappointing. Had I have known, I'd have brought my own stuff. But again, there is a Starbucks in the lobby so it's not like you have to travel huge distances to get a coffee. \n\nBED:\nExtremely comfortable. Lots of pillows. \n\nTV:\nHad the usual stations ... CNN, news channels, some movie channels.\n\nROOM SERVICE:\nWe didn't order any but we did call down to ask for two wine glasses. We'd brought our own wine for the room but forgot our own glasses. No problem, they were delivered in under 10 minutes BUT two things ... one, they were not really clean so again, we cleaned them in the sink with soap before using. Second thing is they charge your room $5.00 for delivery of the glasses. That's fair enough I suppose. We were going to tip the delivery guy 5 bucks anyway for bringing them. That $5.00 is charged to your room.\n\nBATHROOM:\nSpotless. Nice amenities and big shower. Jacuzzi tub worked like a charm. Big fluffy towels (this is important to me, so sorry I had to say it!) And the hair dryer was also in perfect working order. \n\nSTAFF:\nOverall everyone we dealt with was very friendly. \n\nPARKING:\nYou can pay to park your car at the Marriott across the street. It's 35 bucks and is also charged to your room. When you park your car at that Marriott, you can choose to park outside or underground. They give you a tag and you just put it on your dashboard. There are in and out privileges, too, so if you need to drive somewhere, you can come & go as you please. There was ample parking. \n\nOVERALL:\nWe had a lovely time, and the best part was the VIEW.

Location was pretty good, the important amenities easily accessible. \n\nCons: Obviously not a resort-style experience from the price point, but the rooms could use some attention. Our window was more-or-less detached from it's frame, letting in all the sounds and wind from outside; it also did not lock. Security bolt on the door was broken. Using the antique floor heating unit required a lot of contortions even to find the on\u002Foff dial. Bathroom... better not to look, especially at the walls, and only use it when absolutely necessary. Bathroom door also did not completely close.

Had I known this I probably wouldn\u2019t have done it because then we felt like it may have been cheaper if we booked directly with them or on other sites (ie expedia) on top of this, they didn\u2019t have king size bed available and we were offered queen size instead.

The front desk reception at the hotel was awful and wouldn\u2019t let us check into a room without having received Groupon\u2019s confirmation email sent to them directly through their system. Regardless of seeing my email with the order number confirming my booking from groupon at Embassy Suites! We were refused our room and were told to wait in the lobby and contact Groupon or that I could book another room through them at a higher rate and lower category. After an hour and a half I finally got through to a live chat (Because of COVID there phone lines were closed Early) with someone at Groupon who was helpful I thought this would be enough proof to check in but the representative from embassy suites hotel said they needed to call in to talk to them by phone. The group on operator said they couldn\u2019t do that because of covid. So the groupon agent tried to expedite the processing of my groupon. \n\nI have booked hotels many times through groupon, booking.com, Hotwire, Priceline and I have never had such an awful experience. We drove 4 hours to get there to celebrate my husbands birthday, we were hot and tired with 3 children and an infant and they still wouldn\u2019t give us a room and take responsibility to rectify this directly with groupon through their merchant lines which I\u2019m sure they would have gotten through much faster... I don\u2019t know why they wouldn\u2019t call the merchant, and fix the situation. They suggested we get another room (a lower grade category) at their much higher rate and \u201Cdeal\u201D with groupon or cancel later but they could not give me a room without checking in through them directly. They stated that I would have 2 rooms if the groupon went through but I would have pay for both and to get a refund from groupon.. it was a ridiculous solution. \n\nI have worked for hotels as a director of sales and they could have easily checked us in (since they have my credit card), given me a room right away and waited for the delayed reservation and then changed my rate plan. If it didn\u2019t go through then they could charge me at check out! Which is what I suggested. \n\nThis was an awful and embarrassing experience and I was in the lobby fighting with the front desk for a room I purchased for an hour and a half while my kids (4, 7,10 and 2 month old infant) waited in the car wondering if we were going to have to leave and find another hotel\nAfter a 4 hour drive! This is the hospitality industry and we could have stayed anywhere and I expected much more from a hotel of this caliber. \n\nThe groupon live chat agent sent me the the confirmation and I showed the clerk but still she insisted until the reservation came through their system I couldn\u2019t check in then we were disconnected. I thought that this would be over but no. \n\nFinally the manager at the hotel stepped in after I was upset and said they Would check us in and wait for the reservation. \n\nI just cannot believe how poorly handled this was and no one offered us any sort of empathy or compensation for the error. Once we stayed the tv in our room wasn\u2019t working and we had a repair man come and he said that the section of rooms were having a problem with their satellite tv and not all the channels came in! Again, nothing was done and our room couldn\u2019t be changed because they were full. Why would they have the room available knowing there was a problem??! I cannot believe how careless they are with their guests! We were thoroughly disappointed.",1,negative,"August 20, 2020",6700 Fallsview Boulevard,Niagara Falls,Ontario,L2G 3W6

That seems to be the norm these days. Add in people in general prefer to complain about things than find the good things anywhere. Sad but true. SO I was attending a concert across the border at the Seneca Casino and decided to stay one night. I was not going to pay $200 for the Travelodge, so I settled on the Econo Lodge for $119. First off the staff are friendly, I found them to be more genuine than the typical Hilton, Marriott, Sheraton fakeness that seems to be the norm at those chains. Check in was quick. I had a room on the main floor and so I said to myself here we go, what am I going to experience. I walked in the room and wow, not a dump from what others say. Two double beds, AC is the older version but man it had my room cold in no time that I turned it off LOL. I could care less about the TV because I did not come to Niagara alls to sit in my room and watch TV. I can do that at home. I never once turned it on. So that really did not bother me. The two chairs in the corner of the room were great. Sat in one having a couple of drinks before I headed out. The bathroom was a decent size. You get the standard lotion, conditioner and shampoo and two bars of soap. The only small downfall to the bathroom was that the bathtub had some chips in it that were painted over and the ceiling paint was starting to flake. But I guess those things matter alot to most people. I didn't care, the bathroom was clean. Water pressure was fine. The walls are thin as I could hear when someone in the room beside me put the shower on. I couldn't make out any conversations but sure if it was quiet I could hear people talking. The bed was fine. I was sleeping one night and was out late. Pillows could be a bit better. Towels were your standard hotel ones. The property is older but the location you can't complain about. Clifton Hill is right there, lots of food options as well. If you are taking the WeGo bus there is a stop for the Red and Blue Lines right when you walk onto Victoria Street when you walk from the main parking. If you need ice, you go to the front desk and they will give you a medium size bag of ice. That was great. So overll I had not one problem or issue with the Econo Lodge and will stay again.

They do not follow any rules, even if clearly labeled (for example the posted sign for the pool indicates only 10 people at one time can be within the enclosure) but yet will not let me bring my dog inside to make some of said purchases, but dogs are allowed all over the property, their loss now I guess.  Even at 1pm the bouncy ship wasn't even inflated for use. Some staff were quite accommodating whereas others were completely clueless, I would highly encourage management at this facility to evaluate their current staffing process. One other mom of 4 indicated they rented a trailer for 6 ppl although were short utencils, then informed the mom when she called to inquire about another fork to feed her family with to come and pick up a plastic one at the front desk. We were lucky however to meet awesome neighbors from all over and made some friendships to take away from this lack luster experience.  Oh btw highway 406 quite close and you hear traffic 24\u002F7.

Nice that linens, utensils and dishes are supplied - so much less to pack. A screen door on these cabins would be great!  Felt really cut off from things when inside the cabin.  No shade at the site - luckily we were gone for the hot afternoon.  \nThe Boo Boo Deluxe cabins across from us looked very cute and had at least some shade.  Would consider these if staying again.\nStayed here as an alternative to a motel room.  Enjoyed being able to just hang out when not doing activities at The Falls.  Didn't feel as pressured to always be doing something so we weren't sitting around a motel room.\nHaving stayed at Jellystone Park in Amherstburg (when it still was a Jellystone Park), I was expecting a bit more.  The overall feel of this park was that it is past its heyday.  There wasn't a vibrant spirit, and it seemed a bit sad actually.  The store had some souvenir items, but it was an odd mixture of Yogi items and Niagara Falls run of the mill T-shirts and the like.  Had slushy machine, but didn't turn it on until after 11:00 am or so.  It's camping!  Plug the machine in when you open the store - no biggie. There was a tractor and wagon ride with Ranger Smith and Boo Boo, but no Yogi!  And that was the only time we saw any characters - no walks with Yogi or birthday cake deliveries (as we had known from the past).  The movie time was kind of sad too - a regular TV in the rec room playing a DVD.  Not even a couple of Yogi Bear cartoons to start things off.   \nThe front of the campground where the pool, office and store are located is pretty plain Jane.  Not really any nature to speak of.  More towards the back of the campground, there are trees and it starts to feel more campy. \nThere are many little Bare Bones shelters at the back of the campground.  Basic shelters that are like wooden tents with benches to sleep on.  These could be so cute with a bit of TLC!  Tent camping without having to put up a tent.\nThe kids did use the pool the afternoon we got there, and they said it was okay.  Temperature was good, not too cold, but refreshing.\nOverall, we were okay with our choice to stay here instead of a motel.

This past weekend we decided to go to Niagara Falls (Vs Tobermory) a night before our holiday and found even the filthy motels charged \u003E$100\u002Fnight, so we looked for camp grounds that we could do camping as well. We picked Jellystone - with hesitation - as a few yrs ago we considered to go there but my kids didn't show interests. Now they are pre-teens and we wondered if it worked for us. We booked an unserviced tent site. \n\nThe reception staff were friendly, and our site was easy to find. The size is like a van's width and 2 SUV's length with a picnic table and a fire pit. Right behind us was a fence and a local road then the hwy. Zero privacy. The adjacent campers were nice and quiet (even with kids) so there was no problem. It was the noise from the traffic and on the Sat night there were continuous train horns that kept us from a good sleep. It was more \""festive\"" and crowded in the middle of the whole campground where the basic sites (w\u002Felectricity\u002Fwater) and barebone habitats are) when groups of families\u002Ffriends gathered - when you feel happy for them, you are ok, but if not, it is noisy and annoying. The comfort stations (esp. the one next to the pool) are very very clean. The staff clean them regularly and the shower stall and toilets are really spotless (Ontario Parks' can't beat this). The swimming pool is clean, but not heated as advertised. The gigantic jumping pillow is fun. Pedal carts\u002Fbikes rental is a bit pricey and one can only do laps around the camp sites but it's good enough for kids as the parents can feel safe since the area is very contained and not many cars are going in and out. \n\nOverall, we had a good family time there. For serious campers who likes nature and quiet down time, this is not the place, but if one adjusts the expectation and think it's a good alternative to paying \u003E100\u002Fnight for outdated motel rooms, this is a very good option (the couple next to us arrived late, they just popped up a tent, set up fire, put some food from Walmart into tin foil and cooked in the fire pit, then ate, finished with marshmallow, and gone when we woke up next day - not that we were nosy to watch them, they were just right there, too close to one another, and we could hear the campers from the 2 sites opposite to our site - really no privacy). We didn't even bring a cooler as Walmart is 2 minutes away, also Food Basic, Dollarama, Winners, fast food nearby, etc., and Lundy's Lane (with No Frills) and Clifton Hills are only 10-15 mins away. We just bought food from Walmart and grilled\u002Fcooked them. The money saved from hotel\u002Finn\u002Fmotel and dine out was used for rides\u002Fattractions so we felt good! Again, this is not our normal camping experience, but I guess being flexible and budget-wise is good.

I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because of the types of campers that mainly vacation there or how the camp is maintained but I would not bring my Little kids here again. \nAt check-in I was met with an additional $60 bill because we had two young kids, the explanation I was given was it wouldn\u2019t be fair to have couples pay for kids they didn\u2019t have.... WHAT?! A family park they claim... but charge extra if you\u2019re a family.... By that logic you would then think that the activities would be included since you\u2019re paying $3 per day per child but No! Everything is an extra cost and either opens late or closes early (10am, 12pm closes by 7:55pm). The sites are very packed ( preferred sites are not preferred), and when booking for more than one camper don\u2019t be fooled by the online map. We booked two sites side by side ( according to the map) which ended up being a whole site up and across facing another direction. As soon as we arrived to our site the whole thing was covered in a ton of cigarette butts. I asked for someone to go clean it and within 30 minuets everything was picked up. The next issue is laundry, so the washer says $1.50 but in fact it\u2019s actually $2.75 a load ( increased from last years price!!!).  The pool and park leave something to be desired in terms of updating. The activities are ok, wagon ride with character is the only time I say any characters and it was a big max of 8 minuet ride. \nAgain I would like to stress that the atmosphere is not your average family campground, a lot of young workers ( which is great for them to have summer jobs) could be the reason many campers are less interested in having basic camping etiquette. People walk around smoking cigarettes or pot everywhere, people were taking peoples items out of washers or taking over dryer times, I watched big RV campers with huge lights blaring into tiny little campers windows all night long. Loud music right under your windows because the sites are so small. The activities coordinator was really nice and helpful in trying to make the activities beneficial. The noise from the train was annoying, but we left our fan running to drown out the noise. The campground is dated, and understood that Yogi is \u201Cvintage\u201D but they could be doing more to show the new generation what the cartoon is and make them more interested.

My husband went to the office at 10:30 at night to find out who was in the trailer as he had checked that it was locked when we left.  The office had mistakenly given another family the same trailer and that family opened the door and realized they were given the wrong trailer.

We had a large group of about 20 ranging in ages from 78 years old to one years old. (lots of toddlers in our group)  When you first go in it almost just seems like a trailer park.  There are rows of cabins scattered throughout though. We stayed in the bare bones cabin and yeah its pretty \""bare bones\"".  But it did have a light and an outlet as advertised.  I personally am not big on camping but my husband loved it.  It's a very small space.  There are two wooden bunks about knee level to put your air matresses on.  We had our 1 year old daughter with us so once we set up the pack and play we couldn't walk around at all (plus bags and stuff)  There are two chairs on the little porch (came in handy) and a grill (bring your own charcoal) and a fire pit.  Unfortunately, there was a fire ban on so fires only to cook and they must be completely out by 9:30pm (Not the campsite's fault- we've just had very dry weather)  Some groups (within our group) were fairly loud so I had trouble sleeping.  I kept hoping staff would come by and tell them to shut it down LOL  It didn't happen so they're a little lax with that but not with the fire ban.  My daughter loved the tractor ride with Boo boo (free)and she met Yogi at her cousin's bday party there.  All the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful.  Absolutely, no issue there.  The swimming pool was great (free) and the play ground as well(free)  Yes, there are a few add-ons but it wasn't as bad as some of the other reviews made it seem.

I'd rather stay at a dog friendly hotel.  Now- my sister in law rented the Yogi Bear cabin and it was an amazing cottage.  Full kitchen, air conditioning etc.  So if you don't have a dog to worry about then yes!  Its a blast.

Speaking on the phone was a pleasure - all question politely answered and suggestions also given. At time of booking both families requested the site next to model trailer be reserved so we could be next to each other.  We were politely warned they would do their best to accommodate. We called a few days before and happily, the sites were together!  We appreciated that.  There were 2 adults and 3 teens and we fit comfortably. The pool was nice, although smaller than it appeared on the site.  We have older children so can't comment on all activities, but we did see many people doing them.  And yes, Yogi was seen!  It was not too crowded (mid-august) and I think the sites were a good size.  Keeping in mind this is a \""city\"" campground - not the wilderness.  There is a train nearby, as well as a highway, but that did not bother us at all.  The proximity to the falls is great (13 minutes by car). The mobile home we stayed in was older, but extremely clean.  Could use a little refresh - maybe wash\u002Freplace the curtains\u002Frugs.  Maybe a little TLC to the grounds as well.  Kitchen was decently supplied.  There was one critter (after all - it is camping) but within less than 5 minutes of our call, it was removed. Patio and the fire ring are nice.

The bed was comfortable. No problems with the jetted tub. Reasonably priced and the location is within walking distance to the falls. Would love to comment on the breakfast, but there was none! \nI will take responsibility in naively assuming breakfast comes in staying at a 'B&B' but it is disappointing in finding out one of the key reasons you book a place (i.e online reviews complimenting on the breakfast) to be told there will be none. Doesn't help when they have an open guestbook from guests staying a month ago stating how wonderful their breakfast was! \n\nAlthough booked our room 'off season' the overall experience staying here felt like we were an inconvenience to them. The old looking and overly bleached colour towels we were given had seen better days (there is a reason most places have white towels!), the 8 sheets of toilet paper left hanging for us with no replacement on stand by seemed a little harsh. \nWhen asking about using the fireplace that didn't turn on easily the gentleman who showed us to our room stared at us blankly and wasn't sure himself and asked why we would want to use it....because it's the middle of February? Or because it might be nice? We didn't bother in the end. \nOverall, not the best B&B experience and although we do plan on visiting the falls again, we won't plan on staying here.\n\n*Update*\n\nSo the response concerning the breakfast:\n\""There was a misunderstanding about the breakfast, we can not provide breakfast for some reason.\""\n\nAlthough I am curious what that reason may be... it is still a warning to those reading these reviews to not base your decision when people highly praise something you might not be given. I still find it pretty misleading when a place is described as a 'B&B' and only one is provided, but never mind!\n\n'it should show on your reservation. and that is why the price is so 'reasonable' as you said. '\n\nAnother way at looking at it being 'reasonably' priced because at the time in booking it was off season. However, you are in control with the prices but I deliberately paid extra to stay at your B&B because of the highly praised reviews that gave exemplary feedback concerning the breakfast and nice rooms. For whatever reason we were not provided breakfast and for the 'reasonable' price I did pay, I could easily have paid the same (and in some cases less) for a room that did include breakfast. I hold my hands up in that I made the error in assuming breakfast would be provided. I just find it unusual, for whatever reason that we did not. \n\n'For the fire place in the room, i believe it is just for decoration, no one had used it before.'\n\nYou might want to double-check the fireplace because it did look like more than a decoration, but I am not 100 per cent certain on that. Even so, the confusement given when it is the heart of winter as to why we might want to the fire on still baffles me! As to ask us why we would want it on is also confusing as why wouldn't we?\n\n'Sorry we didt provide white towles like hotels, but they are definitely clean' \n\nI never said the towels were dirty. They were clean but very old looking. I don't think every B&B provide white towels, but there is a reason most places probably do! (They can be bleached and not look\u002Ffeel old). I admit, this is only a minor complaint but if want to make a good impression you might want to treat your guests with nicer towels! I probably should have packed a few in my case! \nYou never did reply as to why we were given a practically empty toilet roll despite two guests staying in your room. Again, it is the small touches that make a big impression as the vibe of the whole of our stay felt like we were an inconvenience.  \n\nSummary:\n\nOverall, I didn't expect the red carpet treatment, despite how this may sound. Having stayed at just one other B&B in the falls that was 'a night to remember' ;) I remember how different it was than just a regular hotel which is why I opted for another B&B stay. I was however hoping for more of the same or something close to what we experienced the last time round. My biggest mistake was expecting breakfast at a B&B, a mistake I won't make again. My other fault was having the bar set high and I made my other mistake thinking this place could compete. \nHaving said all that I wish you all well and am sorry it just didn't work out with us.",1,negative,"March 3, 2019",4291 Simcoe St,Niagara Falls,Ontario,L2E 1T5

Despite telling staff and confirming prior to our arrival that we required rooms close to an elevator and that the superior queen rooms had couches in them,  we arrived to find neither request met.  We were told by staff when we called to complain that we could not have been told there would be couches as no adjoining rooms have couches in them.  The failure to have us located near an elevator was never addressed.  The rooms were both very clean and spacious.  There are pub height tables in each room which, while suitable for adults, did not serve the safe or accessible seating needs of our younger family members.  There was a coffee table in the closet area of both of the rooms, why?   Furniture is clean but scarred and chipped.  Beds were not particularly comfortable and pillows are very thin.   One of the 4 comforters smelled so unpleasant that it had to be removed from the room.  Each room had a microwave, small fridge and a tiny coffee maker.  A pouch of coffee and 2 tea bags were included. The bathroom amenities included a shower cap on a tray.  Hand soap is from a dispenser on the wall.  Also there is wall mounted hair dryer with pathetic power.  There were lots of towels and facecloths.  Noise was not an issue between the rooms but hallway noise was very annoying.  Many guest allowed their very young children to run up and down the hallways screaming and yelling.  The common areas are clean and you often see staff cleaning  Staff are not inclined to be friendly or acknowledge guests on either of the 2 days we were there.    We did request extra pillows and a blanket which were brought up very promptly.  Parking was plentiful but the parking lot was ice covered and very dangerous.   Hotel carts are abundant and easily obtained near all entrances.   To reach the waterpark you must walk through an amusement arcade.  Many of the games were broken and the prizes are typical cheap, plastic toys and trinkets found at these establishments.  Unlike GWL the arcade required a ridiculous number of tickets to be redeemed for even the smallest of toys.   The snack bar has a small variety of foods and prices are high for what you get.  The gift shop is similar to most you find in a tourist mecca like the Falls.   The waterpark was not overly busy which was nice.  The water is on the cool side and the hot tub is almost too hot.  The water was clean and clear.  The music is much too loud and we heard more than one person comment on it .  The second day we were there the speakers blared country music nonstop, which also prompted several complaints from people.   We rented a cabana for the day.  It was spacious, clean and comfortable.  We were disappointed that our towels were never replaced with dry ones as is the practice in other facilities like this.   Also when we left the cabana for a couple of hours to have our dinner the cabana was not tidied up nor towels replaced etc.   We were unable to have a normal conversation in the cabana as there is a speaker located directly outside which blares music or the wave pool alert signal.  The activities personnel were great.  The played games from time to time with children receiving a sno-cone as a prize.  These young people were upbeat, enthusiastic and welcoming to all.  All in all we have decided that after 3 visits to this park that we are done with it.  It is expensive for the quality and service that we received.  If you have younger children, the size of the waterpark is ideal.  It is bright inside and balmy.  In warm weather the children can enjoy a small playground on site.",3,negative,"November 18, 2019",8444 Lundy's Lane,Niagara Falls,Ontario,L2H 1H4

We stayed one day with the intention to book another day depending how we felt regarding staying at a hotel during the pandemic.My family and I didn\u2019t not feel very confident in there cleaning practices and would not recommend another stay maybe several months later until they can have a procedure well in place. Hand Sanitizer were not enough or not visible, found staff squeezing in elevator with my family of four making social distancing impossible. The most disturbing is the Waterpark. No greeter at entrance to inform guest of covid expectations nor to ensure hand sanitation before entrance. There isn\u2019t any floor markings  leading to slides to ensure proper spacing between groups, tubes were not wiped down before next guest use.  In the full 3 hrs we were there I saw 1 water park  staff clean a table. I would definitely increase cleaning frequency to wipe  and sanitize tables.

The price we paid was comparable to the larger waterparks in the area.  The lifeguards did interact with the kids making games, which was nice.  However all 3 kids broke out in a rash.  They showered and it didn\u2019t go away.  We put cream on them intermittently throughout the rash.  They had the rashes for about 3 days.  It was super dry skin that was itchy.

I spoke with the manager, and she was going to have the aquatic director contact me, but I\u2019ve never received a call.

All the main attractions of Niagara are a walking distance from this place. You also get a free car parking (which other wise is pretty expensive around Niagara). The check in was quick and the host was nice and gave us some good tips on food and places to see. During peak season the room rents go high. Even during off season the motel was full. So if you want a room try and book it as early as possible. Liked the decor of the room, its in line with the name of the Motel. The room was clean and neat, size is good enough for a couple. The bathrooms are of decent size (Not too big nor too small). There are family rooms available too. If you are looking at a view of the falls this is not the place, but if you are looking at value for money, its a good choice. Give it a Thumbs Up.

The window air conditioner was too small for the window, thus light and bugs came in all around the AC.  Outside, under each unit's AC was a plastic bucket; this was both unattractive and a nuisance to navigate around.

We explored for a bit and then returned at 2:36 to see if our room may possibly be ready a little early. Instead of checking or even nicely saying that they won\u2019t do any early check ins, we were rudely dismissed with a snarky response that check in was at 3.

It was about 15 mins walk to the falls, so distance was ok. \n\nWhen we walked in to asked if they had available room, we were greeted by a nice man Vick Singh. He told us the room would cost $80 for night, no breakfast included, free parking, wifi and very safe (with a person manning the front desk all the time). We paid our $80 and within the next 5 minutes we have learned from another guest that rooms were actually for $60 for them - demanding the difference was pointless and it was too late to argue and we wanted to go out and enjoy Niagara's at night. \n\nSo we went. After a night out we came back around 1-2 am to discover following: no person manning a front desk; two different doors to the place opened for anyone to enter (hence no safe at all!), no wifi in the room (had to go out in the foyer and sat also outside), young people (no guests in the motel) sitting outside and others coming by car and exchanging something (I believed it was drugs since the police came 3x in half an hour!). When I was explaining this to the same man (Vick) who checked us in he was really polite, offered a partial refund when I said I will be complaining. He however had to check with his manager: Gary Sohal, who was a pain in the backside. He was rude, didn't listen to anything I had to say, was cocky and said I should have complained in the evening\u002Fnight and not after sleeping in the room. I told him the reception wasn't manned and I didn't feel it appropriate to 'wake' a receptionist up because there was no wifi and police was circling around - I though it could have waited till morning. Obviously it couldn't have, we haven't received any partial refund, his attitude towards myself and Vick was disgusting - he threw his business card at me, shouted at me and told me to get out of there and complain elsewhere and shouted at Vick - who came to even apologize as we were getting in the card, but he said he couldn't do anymore. \n\nRoom was ok however, spacious, with a fridge and safe, not really clean though. \n\nI don't really recommend staying in this place, although it's not far, and it's off the second main street, I didn't feel walking there and staying there that safe and the customer service was just next to nothing.",2,negative,"September 14, 2014",5553 Ferry St,Niagara Falls,Ontario,L2G 1S3

data/ca/154998/248577/391408806.html,W Inn,"""We booked this place on Booking.com for around $68 CAD per night ($52 US at current rate).  This was pretty cheap for the area, especially considering parking was included at no charge.  However... our experience there was something else.  When we pulled into the lot, we saw an older man sitting out front (the GM \u002F owner I guessed) who followed us into the empty front desk area but told us to wait a moment.  He didn't seem to speak English well.  As we waited for a solid 10-15 minutes in the tiny lobby, the older man was almost alarmingly friendly to our boys (8 & 9), even giving one an unsolicited hug, which kind of freaked us out.  I don't think he intended anything harmful but it was definitely weird and inappropriate.\n\nShortly thereafter, however, a younger man came in to check us in.  We originally had booked 2 nights, but thankfully I'd changed our plans the week before to stay only 1 night.  When I mentioned that to him, he looked confused, but after verifying online, gave us no issues with paying for only 1 night.  He had me sign the ($0) preauthorization slip for the credit card, but we ended up paying cash for the room.\n\nWe booked this place because there was a pool, but when we looked at the pool, we saw the pool vacuum still in it as if had been abandoned in the middle of cleaning.  (This was about the point I thought I was on an episode of Hotel Impossible.)  Our kids really wanted to swim, but between that, and the fact that the pool is literally tucked into the corner of their run-down parking lot, I wasn't particularly comfortable with the idea.  In fact, by the time we came back from dinner, the pool vacuum was still laying in the pool.  (It was gone by the next day, but I'm not sure when.)\n\nAfter seeing the outside of this place, it actually made the motel next door to us look good, and I realized how low my standards were.\n\nIt's a motel, so there's no elevator.  It's all walk-up and we were on the second floor.  This is fine for the most part, except that I'll note if you're really safety conscious, the doors heading up into the building were often propped open, so you didn't need a key card to get in from the outside.  I didn't really worry about this, as the area was pretty quiet, save for various families walking around and a few locals...\n\nThe hallway outside our room faintly smelled like smoke but not surprising considering there were a few smoking rooms in the vicinity.  There was also a small bucket on the outdoor stairs at the end of the hall for cigarette butts, and that door was also propped open (probably to give the cleaning staff some fresh air).\n\nThis theme continued as we headed to our room and discovered that the top door latch inside our room was broken.  It was a cheap latch anyway, but the part that attaches to the door was completely cracked off.  The door still had a deadbolt lock, so I wasn't TOO concerned about our safety, but again... that's a simple fix.\n\nWalking into the room, it did not smell like cigarettes (this is good, it was a non-smoking room) but it was quite musty.  We think this was because the A\u002FC was off and it was a particularly humid day.  We also noted that while there was a fridge and microwave, they were also unplugged.  Probably to save electricity, I get it - but if you know you're having people check in, you should have both the A\u002FC going and fridge on.  Instead we had to grab extra ice for the cooler (ice machine was working well) to keep stuff cold until the fridge cooled down.  It did cool down enough that I could use it by the evening.\n\nOverall, the room was mostly clean - I didn't see anything horrible.  It was more that every single thing was worn down.  Curtains had holes in them so when they were closed, you could see the light seeping through.  Mattresses were VERY low to the ground and soft, as were the pillows.  There were no coverlets on the bed, just sheets and a light blanket.  If you got cold, there were no extra linens.  Our bathroom did have soap and shampoo - but the shampoo and conditioner were just single packets.  (Honestly - I've never seen this, but I don't stay in motels often.)  Luckily, I had thought to bring my own shampoo.  We were also shorted a towel (we only had 3 towels for 4 people) so again, luckily, my friend had an extra towel with her.  The towels they did provide were tiny.  Also, the stopper for the bath was missing, so the kids had to take showers.  \n\nWe noticed a small stain on one of the pillowcases.  Not like it hadn't been washed, but that it needed to be spot-cleaned and housekeeping hadn't caught that.  Other than that - I feel the room was clean.  \n\nThe wifi, while free and available in the rooms, was extremely slow.  Forget about trying to stream anything.  Just looking up some area information took me a good while.  I ended up activating my data on my phone just so I wasn't so frustrated with trying to look up stuff on the internet.\n\nThe TV hutch was missing a drawer on the bottom.  Phone looked like it hadn't been changed in years and the lamp also had holes in it.  There is no coffee maker - just a few plastic cups and an ice bucket.  Luckily, I always bring my own electric kettle & coffee when I travel, but if you're a coffee drinker, you'll have to settle for the gas station that's a block away, or go to breakfast.  None of these things really affected our stay - it was more just the overall perception of the place.  It's a cheap motel.  If I had really needed to save the additional $50, these would not be deal breakers in the end.\n\nAs it IS, though, if I were to do it all over again, I'd probably spend the extra $50-75 to have a room I wouldn't nitpick to death.  When I originally booked it, I was happy to find a good deal, but upon staying here, I realized I probably have higher standards than I thought.\n\nAgain, it wasn't all bad:  the parking was free, and the motel let us keep our car there for the day, even after we checked out.  They were very nice to us, overall.  There were a few cheap breakfast options within walking distance, there's an LCBO about 2-1\u002F2 blocks away, and a pizza place across the street.  If you are on a tight budget and literally just need a room to sleep, this may fit the bill for you.  If you have a family with kids, or if little details bother you, do yourself a favor and spend the extra money.  You can get away with doing Niagara in a day, and then move onto something else in the area.",2,negative,"July 11, 2016",5553 Ferry St,Niagara Falls,Ontario,L2G 1S3

I complained to the landlord and he showed me to another room.  I checked it totally.  It looked better than the first one.  Then I see he checked yet another young fella into the room I had been in without cleaning it properly for bed bugs.  I spoke to neighbours, each and everyone of them were heavy crack users, pot smokers and they drank incessantly.  The music was incredible.

We were thinking of staying at the Falls until we saw the exuberant prices of a good hotels at the Falls for a Saturday night stay.  Most were over $200 and some were not even 3 star quality.

Our expectations were simple; the camp ground must be within a 15 minute drive of our destination, there had to be 2 sites side by side available, the sites along with the bathroom and shower facilities had to be very clean, and it had to have a playground - a pool for swimming would be a bonus.  Well, King Waldorf's Tent & Trailer Park was all this.  When we arrived at the park gate at 11:00 AM Saturday morning there was a 6 car line up in front of us.  We were fortunate because there were only 2 sites available that were side by side.  The staff there was extremely friendly, courteous and helpful from the moment we arrived.

Be warned that the sites where we stayed is quite open, meaning that there are no trees to tie up a tarp for shade or shelter on a hot or rainy day so don\u2019t forget to bring your tarp poles.  Don\u2019t even think of roping the small trees that are located on your site.  These trees are way too small to hold up a tarp and you will damage them.

It's a nice way to travel, not requiring parking and getting exercise. On a hot day, you are even sprayed mist by the falls while still standing on your bicycle, leaning against the railing. Tim Horton's along the way helped to convince my 6 year old that it was ok to ride bikes in the sun, to receive a treat along the way.\nI recommend you find your site and reserve the one you like ahead of time. Otherwise, as our first experience was, you are in a site you or anyone least desires with no privacy. \nThe pool is refreshing with no heating. We stayed one summer a complete week and I thought for sure the water would heat up with all the hot days. I was wrong. Regardless of the cold temps in the pool, it was refreshing to jump in. \nAs for noise, it's a hit & miss. I've stayed many times when there was a bible church group across from us (a group of 100) and they would begin cooking their soups, meals at 5am, clinging the pots and pans while I'm trying to get sleep. Then by 10am the guitar was playing. Oh well what can you do? Then another time, there was loud ethnic music 15 sites over, and not pleasant. I felt sick to my stomach. What can you do? We don't live in a bubble and all have to get along. Is this any worse than hearing heavy metal music up north in Algonquin Park late at night? \nI find many tourists come from Quebec, which is very nice. The children play at the swing set, and meet each other.\nAs for customer service, I was very satisfied.\nOne point, if you go July 1st weekend, be prepared for noise, and messy washroom facilities. The campground tries to employ staff for the holiday weekend, but we have to understand nobody wants to work the first holiday weekend of the summer.

Very simply I book the correct room from the Wyndham Garden Niagara Falls Fallsview site. I just wish others knew how to properly book a room.\n\nWhen I first arrived I was greeted by Ian who set me up in my \""Tower A\"" room right away and I didn't even have to wait for check in as the room was already cleaned and available. Before I left to the elevators I noticed a lot has changed. They don't have a lounge and a bar\u002Fcoffee place. Ian told me they're building an IHOP. I was also told the Arcade has moved and its now in the original spot it was at. I went into that new Arcade spot and its much smaller. I see they moved their data office for customers to browse the internet and print things out. At the time I arrived the whirlpool in the pool area the jets weren't working but that didn't bother me from still using the pool area later on in my stay. \n\nI see they still have the convenience store items and got some souvenirs for people to buy. I see they also sell their own coffee. So the room I was given is exactly the same room I was given last year in October from the \""Tower A\"". A fridge was delivered to my room and I was already able to place my drinks in there. But everything like last time about the room was amazing. The housekeeping staff really do such amazing work on making sure the rooms are fully stocked and cleaned. \n\nAs you can see from my pictures they're still doing construction which is perfectly fine because it just means that the extra fee's we all pay are going towards something instead of going towards nothing. \n\nI love the room I was given especially the LG TV and the channels they have are exactly what I need to watch. \n\nThey had some construction going on within the hotel because of the IHOP they're building and it didn't bother me at all. \n\nEvery day my experience at the hotel was always positive. All the staff I came across were always happy and willing to say HI and ask me how my day was and I was doing the same to them. Inside and outside of the hotel was very clean and it shows how hard the staff work there.\n\nAs usual my experience being there was the same as last time which was amazing. Not sure how people have so many problems with this place when you should first book the correct Tower and then you should just enjoy yourself. It seems like people expect this to be like its a hotel attached to a Casino. \n\nI saw front desk staff helping so many people book activities and telling them where to go to eat or other things. Most things I was doing everything was near by and if it wasn't that close I could either take the bus or take an Uber. \n\n The temperature of my room was easy to change as somedays it was a bit warm and others it was a bit cold. The shower gave hot water and cold water so no problem there. I enjoyed making my own coffee and tea which I did everyday. \n\nAlso thank you to all the staff members for working hard in making my experience here a very wonderful one.

We got a decent deal when we booked - about $279\u002Fnight, not $600\u002Fnight like some of the nights we looked at. My husband and I brought our 3 year old and 18 month old and had a great time. All of the staff were friendly and we were able to get into our room at 230pm the day we arrived which was nice! We visited during a school break week and it was very crowded..there were lines for dinner and the big slides. Our kids were too small for the big slides, so they never had to wait in those lines, but they looked somewhat long. We were never able to find a chair really, so we ended up grabbing towels, shoving them in our backpack along with the flip flops and finding a dry spot on the ground to throw the backpack! Personally, I thought the air and water were a bit chilly. My 3 year old was shivering as was I, but my husband was ok. Better than the 23 degrees it was outside :). We had a \""kid camp\"" room, great themed bunk room for the kids to sleep in - kept them a bit separate for us which was nice.

No worrying about a key! We ended up eating our meals there, and honestly we thought it they were decent prices (we are from the US, and it's in Canadian, so that helps..) We enjoyed the breakfast buffet. Not a ton of people up at 730am so it wasn't crowded then. We ate dinner both nights \""to go\"" from the bucket restaurant in the waterpark.

The reason for the mediocre rating is the value that the resort provides based on the per night fee. We\u2019ve travelled to many family resorts in Caribbean etc and paid about the same price so have a pretty good comparison point of what you can get for this nightly fee.\n\nObservations \n- the nightly fee gets you access to the water park only. We didn\u2019t get the paw pass or all inclusive meal plan and opted to pay on a per activity basis and meals as well. In the end it was more cost effective for our family to do this. But we also had to pack our own snacks and drinks. \n- as a first timer, we didn\u2019t get too much of a welcome or information of what to expect on the resort. All the info we got was by looking online and on the app. The front desk weren\u2019t the most welcoming of staff.\n- the rooms are clean but noise levels are out of this world. It\u2019s a dated building so you can hear voices and footsteps of kids running all the time. Ask for the 4th floor when booking as we hear it\u2019s a bit better for noise levels.\n- food was okay, typical pub fare. There are very little healthy food options.

I have been here before so I ignored the bad reviews that I read prior to coming here. I am glad I did. \n\nFor those that rely on reviews, please read this. \n\n1) I do not find the rooms \u2018 dated\u2019. The rooms are a cabin\u002Fwoodsy theme, it\u2019s supposed to look this way. I personally think its nice. \n2) service, everyone was very nice. I did not encounter any rude staff. Just maybe if you\u2019re nice to them they will be nice to you ? \n3) soap dispensers in the room, I read reviews that this was cheap, for the price of the stay it should be better. Um, ok. This is way better for the environment and I encourage all hotels to use dispensers!! Love this! \n4) check in. We arrived at 3:40 on a friday.  No lineups. I did notice on Sunday at 1pm the line was insane. Every counter had someone working and they were working hard at getting everyone through quickly. If you dont want to wait in line dont show up at 1. \n5) food. The buffet is expensive on my opinion, unless you eat two or more heavily filled plates. My husband and I eat mostly veggies and protein, so the cost was a bit much. But still it was a treat. We did bring our own breakfast and lunch in the room which was great. We had pizza twice, was delicious!! \n6) paw pass is definitely worth the price! \n7) those complaining the prices of the stuff in the gift shop are too high, go to Disney, then you\u2019ll realize how good the prices are in this gift shop. \n8) the pool was not overcrowded-and the hotel was sold out! Plenty of life guards and the lineups were reasonable and often even no lineups. \n9) a few people complained their kids got sick here.. it is flu season.. there are lots of kids. Chances are your child probably had the flu before arrival and symptoms only appeared once you arrived is it usually takes 48 hours to 14 days for symptoms to appear. I dont think its the hotel that made them sick.  \n\nThe few things I\u2019d like to see: \n1)a constant person in the washrooms ( pool area) wiping the floors. As the day goes on, it gets quite wet, and messy. Would be nice if it was wiped all the time. \n2) the floor along the wall from the towel hut to the main doors continuously wiped. It was always dirty with black stuff from people wearing their boots ( those who didnt have a room). Its kinda yucky, i wear my watershoes all the time, but still found it gross. \n3) saturday and sunday night, the room above us was really loud. I am pretty sure the kids were running, jumping, moving furniture lol it was quite loud. It happens. I know my kids were running in the room too and were constantly reminding them there were people beneath us. But it was annoying at 11:30pm still hearing that.  Unfortunately theres no fix for that unless you ask for the 4th floor. \n\nWe had a great time! We will be back !! ",5,positive,"February 23, 2020",3950 Victoria Avenue,Niagara Falls,Ontario,L2E 7M8

Once we arrived, I was astonished at how run down the property was.  It is within walking distance of the falls .... but the houses around it are abandoned and boarded up.  I think this hotel should have been condemned a long time ago.  I travel A LOT and I have never had to leave a hotel before in my life, and I've stayed in some very sketchy places!  \n\nJust for the treatment by management alone, I would advise people to avoid this hotel.  They obviously have NO customer service and are using the hotel as a money grab.  There is obviously no upkeep on the place, the key was an actual key on a piece of large cardboard. The smell of the room was horrible!  \n\nUpon entering the room, the first thing that hits you is the stench.  I was literally gagging.  My daughter started coughing.  It smelled like someone lived there that smoked a pack a day AND was growing weed in the room.  So they tried to cover the smell with a bottle of Febreeze.  That is the best way to describe the smell.  Trying to make the best of the situation, I opened the door and sat outside with the hopes that airing the room out would help.  30 minutes later, I went in to use the bathroom to find that the bathroom window doesn't close and it wasn't opaque.  So anyone walking by could watch me as I used the facilities or in the shower.  That's when I noticed the wires sticking out behind the bed and that's when I went to the front desk.  I asked if they had another room available that was non-smoking.  They said they didn't but they would spray the room.  I went back to sit outside the room and they came with .... you guessed it .... a bottle of Febreeze.  I asked her not to spray the room anymore and she told me that was the only thing she could do.  I quickly went onto my phone and found another room the next block over.\n\nI went to the office and told them that I couldn't sleep there because of the smell.  They told me it was too bad. I asked for a refund and they refused and told me that my card was already charged.  I told them that I was in the room for a total of 10 minutes to use the bathroom and I was sitting outside for the remaining of the hour since I checked in.  She told me that wasn't her problem and took the key back.  I asked if I could have a copy of my receipt and she refused to give me one. I told her that I wanted to take a picture of the receipt at least and again she refused.  I explained that my personal information is on the paper, as well as my signature so I am entitled to take a picture or have a copy.  Again she refused and threatened to call the police.  I told her to go ahead and please call the police.  Only then did she allow me to take a picture of the receipt.  She then started throwing things like her pen around the office, shoved the paper into the desk and slammed the drawer and told us to get out.  Keep in mind at this point she has taken the key back, refused to give us a refund, refused to provide a receipt and has now kicked us out.\n\nI have never experienced such a horrific attitude from hotel management in my life.

This hotel was SO bad, that I'll start with the positives,  just to try to be fair. The hotel staff was friendly enough.  The location is ideal as it's away from the insanity of the town, and therefore quiet. It's a 10 minute walk to the incline tram that, for $2.75, takes you right down to the Falls -- and about a 20 minute walk to Clifton Hill. That part was great.  Now, to reality. This hotel is old, tired, shabby and run down.  What's more - the owners don't seem to care.  It felt to me like they're just riding it out till the bldg is torn down to make way for development.  The room is put together with furniture that doesn't match,  and is broken (drawers with no bottoms,  lamps with no switches,  no settings on the A\u002FC unit).

We were tired and just wanted to relax and watch tv, then get some sleep.  We unpacked our things, were surprised to see the room was not clean at all.  The carpet, furniture was old and dirty.  The fridge was dirty and had a broken door, the bathroom was dirty with only a couple of towels and facecloths - no soap, no hair dryer etc., we looked at the beds and thought o.k. we are tired the sheets look pretty clean, so lets just get some sleep and we will talk to them in the morning about getting another room.  We had watched a bit of tv, an old tv - then went to bed.  We were woken up at some point during the night - with the yelling of the drug dealers next door, looked out the window and saw only drug dealers anc prositiutes coming and going from two or three other rooms there.  Tried to get back to sleep but found the bed crawling with bed bugs.  We were shocked, they were running all over the sides of the bedframe, then i found more in the dresser drawers.  We packed and went to the office to tell them about the bed bugs - all the oriental husband and wife - named Wui and Magan did was argue with us.  They would not listen to us , they didn't seem to care at all about the dirty room with bed bugs.  They wouldn't even give us our money back for the terrible night we had.

data/ca/154998/252841/775517207.html,Niagara Grandview Manor,"""This is not a short, concise review and will apologize for that now. We have been tormented by unwillingly having to relive our recent stay at The Niagara Grandview since our return over two weeks ago. We simply cannot shake this off. In fact, this is the very first time in five decades of travelling my wife and I felt so compelled to document and share our horrific experience in detail.\n\nWe have booked the Grandview Manor exclusively on four occasions over the past three years as it has been our \u2018go to\u2019 destination in Niagara Falls. With great disappointment, that has now all changed. We won't be staying there again.\n\nIt would be a gross understatement to say our recent stay was unnecessarily aggravating, stressful and full of unpleasant surprises. Considering everything happening in our world right now, we were just going to let this go and move on, but upon reflection felt strongly about bringing our inexcusably upsetting nightmare to the attention of anyone who may be considering this establishment.\n\nAs a result of a number of documented emails and phone calls directly with the Inn (in an effort to help avoid the often common mishaps of booking through a third party), we were made to feel like nothing but an annoyance and inconvenience. In spite of this, we decided to confirm our fourth stay with them anyway, so we booked \u201CThe Fraser\u201D room. After been repeatedly assured it was renovated with specific amenities including a covered balcony - information the owner personally confirmed and provided in writing - we discovered upon check-in that the room clearly has no covered balcony. As COVID-19 limits a substantial amount of one\u2019s activities, the ability to enjoy the room and relax within some outside personal 'space' is important now more than ever. It has always been important to us to be able to sit outside regardless of weather, as we have done on our three previous stays with this establishment.\n\nBeyond this inexcusable \u2018misunderstanding\u2019 (?), there was only one chair on the balcony (with nothing appropriate or usable inside to move), so it would obviously not accommodate a couple. What was equally upsetting was that our lodging was merely another stale, tired, weathered room with no redeeming features expected of an historic property at this price point, in an area of the Inn that was dark, dingy, and dirty and STILL under construction after almost THREE years. All of their alleged 'renovations' and high-tech shower did not compensate for the absence of cleanliness, charm and ambience. Let it go on record we have never had any such issues during our earlier stays in The Annex, an adjacent property we greatly enjoyed, which Niagara Historic Inns lost earlier this year after it was reacquired and beautifully renovated by its owners.\n\nHaving gone to great lengths to ensure the details of our booking, we addressed our confusion and disappointment with the Front Desk immediately. In response, we were offered either a full refund or an alternative room in the Alexandria Villa, a newly acquired property nearby (with no balconies). We reluctantly accepted and coordinated a switch of rooms. This not only avoided the property having to incur a loss of revenue but more importantly us having to request a refund which could be difficult, based on other reviews and our experience of having to reschedule our Spring booking - PAID IN ADVANCE IN FULL with cancelled with AMPLE notice - only to be told by the owner he would just \u201Chang on to our money until next time\u201D We were understandably nervous and skeptical a refund would never be issued. So we stayed.\n\nBut so far that was NOTHING... Returning from dinner Thursday evening we noticed something odd in the kitchen. Opening the door, we saw food in Tupperware containers on the counter so only assumed it was someone on site (possibly staff?) checking the property and locking up for the evening. We thought little of it at the time. Less than 30 minutes later, however, a food delivery arrived and there was a group gathered in the kitchen\u002Fdining area eating and socializing.\n\nThey became disrespectfully noisy with their banging and chatter continuing until close to midnight. We didn\u2019t complain or make an issue of this due to what had happened at check-in so just let it go even though it was clearly against the establishment\u2019s long list of official and strict printed guest guidelines.\n\nFriday evening, however, was an inexcusable nightmare. Upon returning from a relaxing afternoon and dinner, we opened the main front door to discover the Villa disgustingly redolent with burned cooking oil and the nauseating smell of greasy food. The odor spread throughout the interior of the building. At least 6 people or more, all without masks, were loudly carrying on and eating on the main floor. We had to deal with breathing and choking on this as it had overtaken our entire room.\n\nAfter enduring this for almost an hour, we decided to ask who they were, why they were cooking and eating in the Villa when the guest rule sheet does NOT allow it and requested they open a window or turn on a fan. No one appeared to understand except one young woman who informed us flippantly they were \u201Cguests\u201D, were cooking \u201CHot Pot\u201D then sarcastically suggested that \u201Cwe should join them\u2019... an insensitive and insulting remark in a COVID environment to join people we don\u2019t know - who are not socially distancing and not wearing masks - to eat food in close quarters with strangers whom we were not even able to communicate with?\n\nAfter this obnoxious encounter, it was impossible to enjoy the evening, our room or a much needed relaxing soak in the Jacuzzi tub we had paid a premium price for. The evening and our one and only get-away this year due to COVID restrictions was completely destroyed and ruined. We were forced to open all our windows and retire early after packing up knowing we would leave first thing in the morning.\n\nWe dropped our key off by 9am and left without breakfast, once a key highlight which everyone raves about and which we always enjoyed. It is now much reduced. The Eggs Benedict were still ok but was the only hot item left, as the other offerings were only the standard mix of granola, fruit and bagels all of which are available at any Travel Lodge, Best Western or Quality Inn at a fraction of the cost.\n\nCompletely exhausted and upset, we just needed to go home without having to deal with an unpleasant or indifferent encounter with the owner.\n\nAs our stay was like any other in the past, after returning home we did reach out to him by email with a summary and questions concerning our experience. He chose to ignore us. Having to follow up days later, we were only blasted with a shockingly condescending, arrogant and hurtful reply. He accused us of not having the \u2018courage' to mention anything at check out, of always complaining (?) - and did not even have the courtesy to address or even comment on a single concern or issue we had. That was totally shameful, especially from the perspective of repeat and loyal customers.\n\nIt is also important to note we have in the past, left positive, glowing reviews for both the Grandview and their incredible staff. The front-line team has never disappointed, always going above and beyond to be accommodating, welcoming and warm. We\u2019ve even left unsolicited gratuities and thank you notes for their services (included this last stay).\n\nConsidering the multitude of options to book a stay in Niagara Falls at prices comparable or much more reasonable than what we paid, our decision to go back as a loyal returning guest was a tragic mistake. The advertised rates for the Niagara Grandview across a great number of travel sites and booking platforms is ALL over the map. The room we booked was even advertised as AVAILABLE for the very nights of OUR stay on Airbnb for over 30% less. \n\nWe thought by booking directly, we would be treated fairly. We unfortunately learned this was not the case.

I booked a king bed with a city view but when I arrived my 'city view' was that of my car that I had to park across the street for $20\u002Fnight, there was no city view. We also did not receive free wifi as promised. Whether this is because it is not available or the lady at the front desk did not give me a password, I do not know. I wish this was the worse of my experience, but it was not.\nMy fiance and I got in very late the night before, and so we went to bed late hoping to sleep in and begin our weekend getaway experiences the next day. However, we were suddenly awoken at 9 am the next day with banging that was coming from our bathroom. I thought someone had come into the room but then realized that it was coming from inside the wall. I then noticed out toilet had backed up and was nearly overflowing and the drain in the tub had backed up, filling it with filth from the drain, It was disgusting. We called the front office and they told us they would have someone check it out. It turned out that there was plumbing taking place at the pool which is next to us. They told us it would be done soon and left. \nAt this point, we were awake and couldn't go back to sleep if we wanted to, but also could not go anywhere because we had no use of a washroom. We went downstairs to ask if they could move us but they told us there were no more kind beds available, but there was a public washroom to use. I was not impressed. I had booked this hotel expecting a nice working room and great customer service. \nWe asked to speak to a manager who went to check the room out. When she returned she explained that the front desk had not understood that the washroom had become unusable and she could move us to a room with 2 queen beds and return $20 to us for parking. While we did not want this, we had no choice. I wish this had all happened quickly, however, this took a few hours to settle. We had to pack our stuff and move to another room. We finally got in at noon, at which point we then had to get ready and go out to do all the things I had planned for the weekend, but sadly missed out on many things because of the time it took to settle the issue.\nWhen I got home Sunday, I wrote to the hotel to ask for a reimbursement of the one night. I was told they reimbursed me the one night of parking to make up for it and that's all they would do.  I told them to keep their $20 and return the $109 I paid for the room I did not stay in, I've been ignored since.\n\nI am sure this hotel is not all bad and there are employees who are great, however, after my experience, I will never return. My experience in Niagara was so terrible.

With the ongoing pandemic, celebrating at all was such a tough decision, but with cases low in our town, and in Niagara, we decided to take a chance. As we looked for a hotel in the area, we wanted to book something 5 star, really splurge and treat ourselves (sadly, we could not find ONE single 5 star hotel in the city), so, we looked through a number of 4 Stars...They all looked great on paper, but the decor and location for the Four Points stood out. So we booked it. This booking ended up being the biggest nightmare, and really started our short trip off on a bad note.\n\nFalse Advertising\n\nFirst and foremost, the hotels boasts \""parking on site available - $21) This is FALSE. Parking on site is $50 and they have a lot across a busy street for $21).\n\nWhen we went to check in, the receptionist was cold, rude and rushing us through check in - which was surprising since not a single other person was in the lobby. We had booked a King Room, No view room but when we spoke, I took a shot in the dark and asked if there were any available upgrades, as we were celebrating our anniversary - she said, there isn't much, but I can give you a room with a Jacuzzi Tub. I said, sure if it's a nicer room than what we have, why not! I thanked her, and we went to our room, in a dark corner of the hotel, on the 2nd floor. As soon as we walked in I noticed 3 things - 1) it smelled dingy and dirty, 2) it looked NOTHING like the pictures we saw on Booking.com or on their website, 3) the bathroom was ancient and tiny. Although I didn\u2019t want to complain, it was not the upgrade we were hoping for, and I thought, well maybe out regular room was nicer, so lets see if we can switch back. We had been in the room for a total of 2min. \n\nI returned to receptions, new staff, and said (roughly)\""Hi there, the lady before \""upgraded\"" us to room 2wtv with a Jacuzzi, but was hoping we could have the room we thought we were booking (as advertised) instead...\"" I proceeded to show her a picture and she said \""Oh, so you wanted a renovated room then?\"" This was a surprise to me because NO WHERE on their site or booking.com does it mention RENOVATED vs NON RENOVATED rooms, all I wanted was the room we thought we were booking...She very rudely explained to me that they do not give people the option to request renovated vs. non renovated and it was luck of the draw...I basically told her, that for any other weekend I wouldn't care, but for an anniversary, (which I mentioned at time of booking and to the last receptionist) one could easily assume we didn\u2019t want the smallest, smelliest room in the hotel, or was that unreasonable? \n\nShe then changed our room from the corner of floor 200, to 2 Queen \""renovated room\"" on the 8th floor. Ok, feeling better, my husband and I made our way to our new \""renovated room\"". Let's start by saying, renovated was a real stretch. The headboard, bedding and carpet were newer looking, for sure, but the bathroom was dark, dingy, old moldy tiles - Cleary not renovated since the bathroom was built. But, my husband and I didn't want to waste another minute, so we said, fine, it will do. UNTIL......\n\nCleanliness\n\nTravelling during a pandemic is a risk, but part of the decision to do it, was the assurances and sanitization measures hotels were advertising. WOW! We were really impressed with the long list of things they were doing to ensure room cleanliness. \""Might not be luxury, but at least its clean!\"" NOPE. My husband, with little effort, instantly found a filthy bathroom, and when I say filthy, I mean, the bathtub area was dirty - including PUBIC HAIR. See picture attached. Not only was I grossed out, but I immediately thought \""we're in the middle of a health crisis where this hotel is boasting cleanliness, but here we find evidence in the first 5 minute that the room is not clean\"" Trust out the window. \n\nPoor Customer Service\n\nMy husband and I decided in that second that we did not want to stay at this hotel. We thought surely with such dissatisfaction in the first 10min of being here, we could ask to leave without penalty and spend the afternoon looking for new accommodations...\n\nI went to front desk, picture in hand and asked what their policy was if we wanted to leave early. the receptionist was SUPER RUDE. She questioned why we wanted to leave and I said frankly, this hotel is not at all what was advertised, we've had rude Customer Service and I have concerns around the hotel cleanliness. She looked at be bewildered...I showed her the picture of the bathtub and asked \""would you be excited to spend your wedding anniversary here?\"" to which she replied\"" Well, what do you want me to do about it? Send housekeeping?\""\n\nAT THE VERY LEAST SEND HOUSEKEEPING, but I said, what I want is to be able to checkout early without penalty - this hotel is putting a dark cloud over our weekend and I don't want to stay here. She informed me that we could not leave without penalty but she would cancel the next two nights.\n\nWe left to go get a bite to eat, look for a new hotel and call booking.com to see if they could help us.\n\nI tried to call a manager myself, but I was left on hold and then disconnected several time, so I contacted booking, and sadly, as much as they tried, the hotel manager would not budge and let us leave. Their argument was that we had \""used too many rooms\"". Used was a stretch, we had been in each room under 5min TOTAL. Finally I got through to a manager and explained the situation - they refused to budge but at the end of the call, they offered to move us up to a room on the 17th floor with a view. I said, I don't care if the room is in the penthouse, I don\u2019t want it if it isn\u2019t clean. They agreed to send housekeeping up before and we ended the call.\n\nNow, when I checked back in after dinner, not one person addressed the situation, offered their apologies or anything else.\n\nWe went to the room and it was fine, clean at least - HOWEVER, there was no water available - they give you tokens for vending machines but they were either out of water or not working and the store in the hotel was closed....\n\nWe agreed we would leave in the morning and check in to the Sterling Spa and Inn (HIGHLY RECOMMEND!! The staff were amazing, nice, accommodating, it was CHEAPER than the Four Points and had more amenities (free coffee in the lobby, large clean gorgeous rooms, a spa on site, complimentary water bottle in the room and onsite parking for $15). \n\nWe checked out at 8:30 am, we couldn't wait to leave. When I left, I decided to reach out to the Four Point Sheraton on Facebook to explain the situation and see if they, as an organization could comp the room for all the trouble we faced. They opened a case, and we received a very rude, condescending, and frankly, nasty email from the hotel director. See picture attached.\n\nThey claimed they were super accommodating and nice, that we \""wasted\"" several of their rooms and we just were simply unhappy. NIAGARA FALLS WAS A GHOST TOWN... There is no way we WASTED any of their rooms...every hotel in the city had vacancy, including theirs, we called to be sure...\n\nThey also said they gave us complimentary parking, which was NEVER COMMUNICATED to us. If they wanted to dazzle us with parking, or offer a gesture, they could have offered us parking onsite complimentary, but no they didn\u2019t. The whole email was so frustrating to me because it was so far from the truth. I let them know I would be leaving honest\u002Fbad reviews everywhere and that I thought their email was condescending and uncalled for. They declared case closed and that was that. ALL we wanted was to leave and stay somewhere else without being charged $150 for a night in a nasty room\u2026we didn\u2019t ASK for anything else but a clean room.\nOH and the icing on the cake???

It was unfortunate for us that the hotel was fully booked (so we couldn\u2019t switch rooms) and it just so happened that the folks next door were partying for the night.\nThey were VERY \u201Cintimately active\u201D all night long.

We checked in on Sunday, the arrows on the floor due to COVID precautions were very confusing which cause people to bump into each other. The \u201CA\u201D elevator seemed to be the one elevator in which ever took. We stood there for almost 10mins before an empty elevator could bring us to our floor. Our room was on the 8th floor, City View Double Queen. When we got to our room there was makeup on the pillow, damaged furniture, pink stains on the carpet, dirt stains all over the skirt of the bedding. We immediately called customer service and explained what we witnessed. They told us to come down and we would be switched to another room. So we did, and had to wait another 10mins to get back downstairs. There was a very brief and vague apology, the receptionist switched us to another room on the 10th floor. We went up to the room and i wouldn\u2019t say it was an upgrade other than the beds looked clean. \n\nShortly after we arrived in the new room we received a phone call from front desk telling us we need to move our car immediately because it was just a temporary space to unload and if we want to keep our vehicle there it\u2019s $50\u002Fnight. WHAT?! Here I am thinking we are receiving a call to find out how our new room was. Nope, not at all. My husband explained we literally just got into the new room and we haven\u2019t even looked around thoroughly and once we were done we we would move the car to the other parking across the street which they charge $21 for smh.\n\nWe went out on the town for a few hours, came back and decided we were hungry so we would use up some of our coupons which included $100 off Ruth\u2019s Chris. We did a review and checked out some prices and it was NOT worth it. First off the rating was 2.3 stars and secondly the $100 coupon was really 80 something dollars plus tax which equaled $100 lol. The menu was 3x more expensive than the regular Ruth\u2019s Chris relocations in the GTA. With such poor ratings we decided it was not worth it and we would try the Outback Steakhouse. We used the room phone to call and inquire, which was a mistake because the hotel charged us for using their phone! Can you believe it? We got charged for making a LOCAL call to a restaurant down the street which was less than 2mins! \n\nAfter hearing their pricing as well, we decided we were spending way more money using the coupons and we were better off sticking to somewhere we were familiar with. \n\nWe ended up ordering Boston Pizza and played a few board games until we fell asleep. Or atleast that\u2019s what we thought. We kept waking up to sounds of teenagers running up and down the halls, yelling, and slamming doors in and out. After 30mins of the same foolishness, the waking of not only ourselves but our 2 children, my husband goes out and tells them to keep it down. And hour later the same thing again. So we can front desk, explain the situation and they claim that they would send up security. Not sure if they really showed up or not, but then noise continued until wee hours of the morning. \n\nThe next morning, I was anxious to leave. I was cranky and annoyed because I was looking forward to a mini get away seeing that we\u2019ve pretty much been locked up due to COVID.  We packed up our stuff, proceeded to check out when we saw a group of people possible about 6 walking around the hotel without a mask which is supposedly mandatory in public areas of the hotel. No one mentioned anything to them. \n\nWhen checking out I was given my outstanding balance which was $21 for parking, $1 and change for a 40sec phone call +HST. \nI wasn\u2019t asked how my stay was, no \u201CThank you for staying with us\u201D No type of Hospitality.

I liked the personality and character of the house. It was decorated with brilliant, regal antiques, but without being stuffy and pretentious. The old home is beautiful and there are so many cool little knickknacks and decorations around that you just want to keep exploring. I also loved sitting on the porch and strolling the garden.\n\nOverall, it was a admittedly a little less personable than other B&Bs we stayed at, but I think this is because the owners may not live on premises. For instance, we only saw the inn keeper in the morning during breakfast. When we arrived, there was an envelope with a welcome letter and keys on the door. This was totally fine, but felt more like an AirB&B than a traditional bed and breakfast, except someone was there to cook for you in the mornings and make your bed! So not a bad thing, but just an observation on how it was different from other experiences.\n\nDespite being less personable, the owner was extremely hospitable! He was a very kind man, who was extremely helpful in giving us pointers about our itineraries. For instance, when discussing our plans for the day we told him about going to Niagara on the Lake and doing wineries. He referred us to three wineries and gave us complimentary tasting coupons and also pointed out another town we could see on the same day. \n\nWe stayed in the Terrace Room, and I was at first somewhat skeptical because it was a parlor room off the formal dining room that had been walled off and converted into a bedroom. As a result there was a private bathroom for our exclusive use, but it was located across the hall. The rest of the guest rooms are separated by another entrance, so unless people were going to the breakfast room, they had no reason to be in our hallway. So it wound up being more private than I immediately thought. And the bathroom across the hall was never an issue. On the bright side, the room was really big with a luxuriously comfortable bed, and its own doorway leading to the side of the wraparound porch. We utilized this to go in and out and just sit on the rocking chairs. Rather than feeling like a rented room, it honestly felt like we had rented an entire house to ourselves, which was amazing coming from NYC apartment living.\n\nAs for the area, I couldn't get a great read of it. It is about .75 miles to 1 mile to the Falls, depending which way you walked. We had absolutely no problems, but the area felt a little desolate at night. I am a runner, and it was perfectly located for my morning runs. I would take one road all the way down to the Niagara Falls promenade, and very easily accomplished 5 miles a day without straying far and while maintaining scenic views. If you're not a good walker or have kids in tow, it may be a little too far from the heart of the tourist attractions. Otherwise, the neighborhood was very residential and had a college town feel.\n\nI would definitely stay at this B&B again and would recommend it for anyone that doesn't want to stay on the busy commercial strip. Parking was no problem, and we could walk to dinner. I loved the funky feeling of the home, and the interesting decor. We also greatly appreciated tourist tips from the owner and used our complimentary wine tour vouchers.

And the tub takes over 40 minutes to fill! The tub had a battery-operated candle on its shelf but it did not work.\n\n Almost all the TV channels did not work. They do provide you a DVD Player but their selection of movies was all horror and depressing dramas. Where are all the romantic, the comedies, the Adventure movies? \n\nThere is a fridge and microwave outside the room but it is communal. The Mircowave could definitely use a clean. If you want a utensil, milk or salt and pepper, you are out of luck as the kitchen is locked and there is no staff to open it until morning.\n\nBreakfast is amazing. The food is hot, the tea selection is massive, and the partial owner is very sweet. As for staff they are non-existent. The only time we ever saw the owner was at breakfast and even then, although he was friendly he stayed in the kitchen the entire time. We tried to ask him some questions as to places we should go but his response was to hand us a map and tell us the map held all the answers. WHAT?\n\nThe place was charming but to me there is nothing special about it. Yes, it had a fake fireplace and a jacquzzi but what turned me off was the cruddy checkin, the non-existant staff, and the little touches that make a stay feel more special. It was an ideal location but I won't stay again.",3,negative,"May 28, 2019",5982 Culp St,Niagara Falls,Ontario,L2G 2B5

We had noticed how nice the Doubletree looks from the outside on one of our walks, and I had stayed there about 12 years ago and remembered being so impressed by the gorgeous lobby. Quick online search later, we were booked... the deals are incredible right now for hotels in Niagara! I found a lower floor, city view at $83\u002Fnight and we were upgraded on arrival to a \u201Cfallsview\u201D on the 8th floor. \n\nOverall I was super impressed... \nThe service especially blew me away. After I made my online reservation I was contacted by text by the hotel, and I asked if we could possibly arrive early that morning as we were just moving between hotels on Fallsview blvd, they said no problem :) \nAs I mentioned we were slightly upgraded, from having stayed there already IMO the Fallsview rooms are not super worth it because there is no real view of the falls from this hotel. \nBut that would be my *only* negative with this place. \nShortly after checking into our room I was contacted again by text by guests services asking if the room was to our satisfaction, I asked for a couple more coffee pods and they sent up about a dozen within minutes! \nAwesome service \u2B50\uFE0F \nCoffee pods, but what for you might ask??

There can be an early and late train just a heads up. \n\nMy main complaints are some sites numbers are very confusing as they point the wrong direction and people tend to have no clue where to park (at least this seemed an issue on Vine  Street). \n\nThe 30 amp spots have no 15 amp additional plugs for use for outdoor accessories for outdoor cooking etc. The hook ups are positioned a bit far away from where you end up on the angled spots. As a result people seem to be fighting over water hookups. \n\nNo one from the park seems to care that older kids are constantly breaking the rules on the bounce trampoline putting young who play in danger.\n\nAlso park wood is overly pricey at $12 a bag.

All other hotels were charging your typical ridiculous summer time prices; Most places in Niagara falls are run down and dirty. The Rex is little hidden gem. Reasonably priced, very well maintained, clean, cute and stylish. Our room was an African style decor and was lovely. The picture you see posted is exactly what you are going to get. Room #10 was quiet, beautifully decorated and super clean. The cleaners take their shoes off at the door when they enter your room to clean; just to give you an idea of the attention to cleanliness. The person who decorated these rooms is definitely an interior decorator as the room was perfectly balanced and both colour and theme coordinated. The bathroom did not have a tub but the shower was tiled and modern. The inside of the bathroom reminds me of  upscale resorts in the Caribbean with stucco walls, artistic metal gecko decorations and a stylish mirror.

Its great for walking or biking.\n2. Service: We got in around 11pm. The door was answered right away, check in was efficient and we were shown to our room in no time at all.  Also breakfast was brought to our room right on time!\n3. Amenities: You have pretty much everything you will find in a mid-range hotel room: Fridge, hair dryer, coffee pot, iron, bar soap, shampoo, lotion, wifi etc.\n4. Parking:There was ample parking and no additional fees for parking.\n5. Privacy: Breakfast is served to you in your room.  This affords privacy to those who are not so comfortable eating with strangers.\n\nThe So So\n1. Thin walls: We could hear other guests having breakfast on their balcony in the morning while we were still in our room.  If you are  a late sleeper, ear plugs\u002F noise cancelling head phones should solve that problem.\n2. Signage inside the room: There is a window between 10\u002F11pm and 8am when they ask you not to use the Jacuzzi tub because the motors are loud.  This rule was not written with the instructions for the tub in the bathroom.  It was in the general rules list in the main room.  One could easily miss it.\n3. Cleanliness:  The room and bathroom was clean for the most part.  However, there was some mildew around the tub, and when I was double checking the room to make sure we did not accidentally leave anything behind, I discovered things from previous guests under the bed, along with dust bunnies.  A little more attention to detail to this area would be great.\n4. Breakfast: Breakfast consists of fruit, pastries, parfait and coffee\u002F juice.  It was good and filling, but don't expect a hot breakfast here.\n\nAdditional Comments:\nBoth rooms we booked came with Jacuzzi tubs.  Unfortunately it was too late to use them when  we checked in so I can't comment on anything outside of the aesthetics. \n\nOverall, we all enjoyed our stay there and would consider staying there again the next time we are in the area.",4,positive,"July 9, 2014",5395 River Rd,Niagara Falls,Ontario,L2E 3H1

When we checked out the next day, I asked if we could leave our car there until later in the day, and the answer was an enthusiastic yes.\n\nKings Inn may not look like much, but for things that truly matter to us, namely the bed, the cleanliness, the peace and quiet, free parking, and things that we used, table & chairs, fridge, they were in great value and good quality. I highly recommend this motel!\n\n",5,positive,"October 27, 2018",5525 Ferry St a Stanley Avenue,Niagara Falls,Ontario,L2G 1S3

The blankets on all 3 beds had holes in them, there were hairs all over the sheets. The bathroom smelled of urine, and there were pubic hairs on the back of the toilet and the floor. The room was also incredibly hot and the windows couldn't be opened because they were firmly taped shut. And there's no fans. So I got no sleep because I was too hot.\n\nThere was also a dirty, old pin in my bedside table drawer. \nAside from all of this, the lady at the desk was quite nice and left a note for us when she stepped out. To my understanding, we were the only tenants in the entire building. Also, the room is... \""quaint\"" and comfortable. Just very unclean. \nThe only thing I find very strange and not really a good thing, is that the lady at the desk, the ONLY staff in the building, left. Said it was her day off and that we, the customers, were responsible for locking the door and turning off the Open sign. That's just... a little odd... \n\nCame for one night and were told we had to get out by 11am the next day and no later. Kicking us out that quickly for what we paid?

Leads one to believe there is no regular cleaning done in halls or at elevators.\nIf smoking bothers you, there is always someone smoking outside the entrance doors to the lobby you have to pass through.\nNice pool, but no upkeep throughout the day, or limits on bathers.  Pool was quite full in the afternoon - very difficult to maintain social distancing. (We chose not to use.)  Went back later in evening, around 9:30 pm. and was obvious there had been no cleanup done - towels strewn about, garbage on deck.  Observed 2 sketchy people scoping out the perimeter fencing, and then they were in the pool area - had apparently followed in behind other guests.\nThe area is frequented by homeless and questionable sorts.  Make sure you lock your car.  My fault, small town girl mistake.  Went out to the vehicle after our first night to find it had been ransacked.\nNever see any staff around other than front desk.  Seems there could be some more monitoring\u002Fupkeep.\n\nThe rooms are decent, but there is definitely room for improvement in the overall operations.\n\nOkay place to stay, but nothing that makes you feel they've taken any great effort to make you want to come back.",3,negative,"July 9, 2020",5905 Victoria Avenue,Niagara Falls,Ontario,L2G 3L8

Accommodations at The Oakes Overlooking the Falls\n- Well, that\u2019s the name of the hotel so we had to pay more for a room that actually had a view of Niagara Falls\n- the room was filthy, the lamps bases had never been cleaned with a layer of grime that needed a scrubber and maybe some comet ( this is during COVID so it should have been polished clean) \n- the sheets didn\u2019t fit the bed and were extremely wrinkled like they just sat crumpled in a pile for weeks  before getting put on the bed. \n- the pillows were old, small, cheap, cut up foam like you buy for $7 at Walmart. \n- the bathroom had been upgraded but the jacuzzi tub had rust around the faucet and the jets looked so dirty I thought for sure I would get an infection, you know where, if I went in it.\n- the towels were old, worn and needed replacing. \n- there was a small fridge but the room was barren. It had no coffee maker, no kettle. No coffee or tea, no cups, no wine glasses, no microwave, no amenities whatsoever\n- the front desk clerk said that was because of COVID but we have stayed in over 20 hotels during COVID and they have ALL had full amenities available in the room. The other hotels just sanitized them or wrapped them in plastic. \n2. A bottle of wine and chocolates\n- the wine was cheap, acidic and reeked of yeast when we opened it and the plastic label sticker was coming off. And we we were handed the bottle of wine and chocolates at the front desk at check in - why weren\u2019t they in our room? They expect us to take up our luggage and juggle these Romance Package items?? Ridiculous! \n3. A three course dinner at Remingtons Steakhouse\n- the value was supposedly $69 for very mediocre food. The prime rib soup tasted like it came from a can, the pasta tasted like the sauce was from a jar, there was no flavour to the garlic mashed potatoes or the prime rib and the lava cake had some form of edible oil product instead of whipped cream and they spread jam on the dessert plate instead of making a berry coulis, which I had to pay a 5$ up charge for as only store bought ice cream was the included dessert which they called gelato. We love gelato and purchase it frequently and this stuff was nothing more than a generic brand of ice cream. \n4. Breakfast at Applebee\u2019s\n- well Applebee\u2019s only serves breakfast on Saturday and Sunday and we booked the package on Sunday night. They did not tell us at the time of booking that this was not available. \n5. A $20 voucher for Applebee\u2019s \n- you must buy 2 entrees which are each typically $20 and up \n- they don\u2019t even open until 2 o\u2019clock so you can\u2019t use it for breakfast or lunch. \n6. Parking is $35 additional per night\n\nOverall, it was a very disappointing experience. I will never again book a \u2018boutique\u2019 hotel nor will I book something with dinner included.

Of course, we walked right out and booked at a different hotel. I\u2019ve never seen anything like this in real life. The stained lamp didn't have a bulb or a switch but it was surrounded with food, just as the toilet and tub were surrounded by pee, and of course the gaping moldy hole in the ceiling was above the bed in our \""upgraded 3 bedroom suite\"". I included a few photos but  have a lot more pictures that are just as disgusting, like the hair on the bed, the two unplugged mini fridges blocking the door that still had food in them, the mirror strewn with toothpaste spit, the tub filled with layers of what looked like urine, and the layers of unidentifiable sticky goo on the table, just to name a few.  \n    If you question whether or not you should consider this property, please consider the reviews on here. Trust me, you will make up your mind very quickly. I have always taken the negative reviews with a grain of salt. I am not picky and don't mind staying in very low budget hotels or hostels. This was the first time that I walked out of a place and the first time 'm taking the time to write a negative review. It's that bad. We had to instantly last minute book a new property that night to stay in since we clearly couldn't stay at this location. Hopefully these pictures kind of give you a general overall taste of the hotel, not that you\u2019d want a \u201Ctaste\u201D of this hotel!

Instead we found ourselves dealing with this. We had to book another property which was much more expensive. When we went into the office to cancel(I bought the cancellation insurance but I'm still dealing with this a week later), the guy was not surprised that we didn't want to stay there. I'm not usually one to complain so I awkwardly said, \""Ummmm...we can't stay here.\"" He casually replied with, \""Ok. We'll refund your money. That's fine.\"" I asked how we go about doing that and he said we have to call Hotwire and that Hotwire will then contact them and it will be done, no problem. I called Hotwire the next day because we had to deal with getting a new place with two very young kids later at night. When I called, the very nice customer service representative tried to contact the property but said that they weren't answering the phone and that I'd have to wait 7-10 days for a response. I'm fine with that but if this ends up not being refunded and if Hotwire still works with this property, I will take issue with it. Like I said, I'm usually not a complainer and I usually do just let things go, but this was an incredible circumstance, a major inconvenience, a n unnecessary extra cost, and not an experience I'd like to think might possibly happen again...to anyone! \n    I will be contacting the city of Niagara Falls and Canada's version of OSHA as this hotel should be condemned. You can see, and smell, what's going on from the sidewalk and it is in the heart of everything. I have no idea how this place is still in business. It says it's under new management. Well, apparently they don't care either. By the way, they say that they have a deal with the local indoor waterpark, they do not. I asked and they said they don't do that anymore. Not that that would be my concern here. But still, it's more false advertising. DO NOT STAY HERE!!! You are throwing your money away and will need to rebook somewhere else last minute.

They DO NOT have FREE breakfast. Room was NOT clean. Room smelled like smoke. No HOT water. NO smoke alarm. They don't seem to clean anything after guest leaves.  We found hair, make up smudges and some brown stains on the towels, bed sheets, and pillows. The owner told my husband that he will see what he can do about the one night refund. I have followed up with them twice and they ignored the emails. I feel very robbed and wronged. Do not let these people take advantage of you. Other reviews on here seem to be fake. I fell for it and now I regret it. One night refund out of 4 nights is not unreasonable. You guys did not provide the service and the advertisement that you promised. Taking money from people who did not sleep at your motel for one night is just wrong.

Once sorted out she gave us room 121 which was soo disgustingly dirty that I wouldn't let my dog stay there. Upon opening the room the smell was a mixture of musty air and old cigerette smoke. It stunk!!! The carpet was so dirty you couldn't tell the original colour with stains all over it and I had a one year old baby who would have been crawling on it. The bedding was dirty and looked like it was used already and not changed from the other guests. Walls were very dirty. Needless to say we asked for another room. They gave us room 201. It was somewhat cleaner, at least it didn't smell but still not the cleanest. The whole motel was dirty overall. The continental breakfast is a joke. Its a loaf of bread and butter with jam and a two piece toaster if you want toast but the whole time the owner was rushing us to hurry up so you are lucky to get 2 pieces toasted. The only drink option was coffee no tea or juice for kids and the water for the coffee was only warm like from a tap not even boiled. On top of that because the owner was rushing us to hurry up he popped my mothers toast out of the toaster and took them out with his bare hands to give them to her.

There was no toilet paper in the room at all and the bathroom wasn't even clean from the previous guests.

Check in could be a tad earlier but the rooms are fabulous.  Upgrade to Jacuzzi tub room.  I always ask for the chocolate covered strawberries they are over priced but OMG GOOD.  I cannot say enough about this hotel it is by far the best in the area.  Better then any falls view room that is over rated and over priced. The breakfast is very simple but laid out so elegantly and adorable.  Always a nice touch.  Now for the changes that should be made.  Let's put some benches in a smoking section instead of 10 smokers standing at front entrance.  Also lets loose the $17 plus tax parking.  I get so tired of people getting taken advantage of in a tourist town.  Don't be like the rest of the hotels.  There is parking next door for $5.  Even if you just charged $10 for entire stay.

I was returning my boyfriend to the airport the morning after our stay together, so he could return to Thunder Bay. We're young and haven't had much hotel experience in our lives, me less than him. This was my second time checking into a hotel by myself so I was naturally anxious. The woman at the front desk immediately made us feel comfortable and welcomed, talking to us about our trip and our plans, and was very encouraged to make sure we felt at home. I wasn't expecting to get a call minutes after we arrived to our room, they were already making sure we were doing okay. It was awesome and we definitely felt like important guests at the hotel. Not only was the service amazing but our room was perfect. Well worth the money and the shower + tub made for a great relaxing last night for us to spend together. Everything was clean, the only flaw was one of our bathrobes was a little damp but it didn't matter all too much. I thought the binder of the history of the hotel and all the recommendations and information was cute and helpful. The orange water up front was yummy and all the staff were respectful when we passed them in the hallways. We received the breakfast in bed which was delicious the egg wraps were amazing I would have paid for more. The front desk was just as friendly at check out as check in was, overall I'll never stay at another hotel in Niagara Falls if it isn't this one, I'm amazed at the service and experience during this troubled time for the tourism and hospitality industry.

We were honestly blown away at the size or our room.  The room is very spacious, in no way will you feel squished like most of the rooms in the big chain hotels.  Our room had the jacuzzi tub which we took full advantage of. The king bed was very comfortable, the breakfast the next morning was delivered on time and the egg wraps were still hot!  Not the usual case with some of the room service we've experienced in the past at other hotels.  \n\nThere were just a few minor annoyances, the tv is very difficult to find any free cable channels if you want to just relax a little before dinner or bed and not get into a 2 hour movie ( lots of on demand however).  It would be nice if there was a way to separate the two from the guide.  It also took quite a while for the water to become hot to take a shower or fill the jacuzzi but once it arrived, there was definitely no shortage and it was definitely hot.  Both, very minor issues that will not keep us from returning.\n\nOverall, there is no better value anywhere in the falls that we could find.  With it only being a 5-10 minute walk to the falls, why pay 50-60% more just to be in hotel closer with a basic room and amenities?  We decided to make this our destination spot when we need a romantic getaway.

Each room is exquisitely decorated, romantic too with rose petals and wine glasses,  the private baths are far more than you could ever imagine with a walk-in  shower the size of a room. We had a lovely room off the patio, where we enjoyed some fine wine served by our wonderful hosts, Dianne and Gary. I can't explain how at home you feel here, it's as though you are staying with family or friends .  There is however plenty of privacy  the main part of the house is separate. There is a whole side of the home with an entrance just for the guests which has a lovely foyer and a room that joins the main dining room in the house. Open during winter also with a wood burning stove in foyer. You must check out the pictures to get the full beauty of the home. It is located in a great spot, country setting yet  easy access to all the wonderful attractions in the area. Now for the breakfast part, it is absolutely wonderful a special surprise each morning made with care  and love by Gary.  I would be remiss if I didn't mention  how wonderful and clean everything is.

This voucher had no indication of how many people were to be accepted staying in the room, but stated there were 2 Queen beds which seems to indicate more than one couple. (I have attached a photo of the voucher)\nUpon checking in, the unenthused desk concierge failed to acknowledge or greet us with a kind welcome. \nI approached the concierge, told him we were checking in and presented the gift voucher. \nHe asked how many people and I told him 4 (my sister and our boyfriends) he claimed that they are usually used for one couple but because it was not stated on the voucher he would allow us to keep our room booked for the four of us.\nAfter checking in we went for dinner and drinks, and came back to the hotel later in the evening.\nMy sisters boyfriend had come back to the hotel earlier than us, so upon our return to the property it was myself, my boyfriend and my sister.\nThere was a different concierge at the desk upon our return, who immediately stopped us at the door and asked where we were going. We explained that we had a room booked and the previous desk concierge allowed 4 of us to the room.\nHe then proceeded to harshly accuse us of not knowing the rules and told my boyfriend he could not stay in the room.\nIt was 3am, our phones were almost dead and we had all been drinking. He would not let my boyfriend explain a word and told him he had 5 minutes to gather his things and leave. Keep in mind, due to COVID the hotel was basically empty so I am not sure why this was such a big problem. If these were truly the rules we should not have been able to check in as 4 to begin with. \u201CChanging your mind\u201D at 3am and leaving a guest with nowhere to stay is completely unacceptable. Working at a hotel myself this would have never been handled in this manner and in such a rude way. (This took place the night of Saturday July 25th with whoever was working the overnight shift that night, he claims his name was Tom but I am not sure if that is true).\nI was absolutely shocked by the lack of professionalism, basic etiquette and compassion from the desk concierge. All guests should be able to leave the hotel when they please, relax and enjoy their night without worrying about a place to stay upon return.\nI am beyond grateful a friend was able to bring my boyfriend home safely, however if he wasn\u2019t available I\u2019m afraid to think of what could have happened to him. \nI felt extremely unsafe as the desk concierge prioritized a false policy over a guest\u2019s safety. \nI can only hope that this does not happen to another guest in the future and expect management to course correct and hopefully retrain their employees in customer service.",1,negative,"July 30, 2020",7514 Lundy's Lane,Niagara Falls,Ontario,L2H 1G8

On their website the room apparently was supposed to be: \""Clean and comfortable room with queen bed, satellite TV with remote, alarm clock, individually controlled heat\u002Fac, in room phone, free local calls, 5 piece washroom, (mini fridge,micro, iron and board) available.\"" So let me break this down to what we actually got. Not clean, not comfortable, we did get a queen size bed but upon inspection there was crusty SNOT (yep boogers!) on the duvet cover in plain sight. When we arrived they said oh your lucky you showed up cause we have turned away like 100 people to save your room.. which I thought was crazy cause you do not have to arrive at check in so why is it that when I arrived you were JUST cleaning my room. Furthermore, they obviously didn't finish cleaning the room cause I could feel dirt and stuff still on the carpet, the snot on the duvet cover and one towel was clean (I smelled the towels and the key to this is if they smell like bleach you know their clean), also there was still socks, garbage, a bottle of cranberry juice and a tape measure on the floor at the foot of the bed. The shower was not cleaned as peoples hair was still sticking to the walls along with mildew on the ceiling. There was not satellite TV as per what was mentioned in the description of the room, in fact there was no TV at all. The mini fridge they mentioned was not working so all of our drinks were room temperature. The pool is a joke it's literally a pond. \n\nMe and my boyfriend spent the night on the town and saw the sights and such, at around midnight we decided that we could not spend the night in that bed knowing how unclean it was with all of the things we found in just a half hour of changing for the evening to go out. We up and left the key on the bed and drove home at midnight- and we are from Durham Region. \n\nDo not go here, there are plenty of decent hotels in the area and for an extra $50 bucks you get 5 stars better than the desolate third world rate of this hotel.",1,negative,"August 2, 2009",3665 Macklem St Niagara River Parkway,Niagara Falls,Ontario,L2G 6C8

I looked for the availability and the rates for the night I was planning to stay, and although you can do a reservation online, I noticed it was not a secure website, therefore I just called the hotel directly, told them what I found and they confirmed all the information as correct (availability on that date, type of room, total price).\n\nSo, when I got there, the guy at the reception gave me a registration form that had my name, payment info and a total that did not match the one I was told... obvioulsy higher! I explained that to him and even showed him a print out of the information that I did my self of what I was supposed to be charged based on the information I was confirmed when I called to reserve(including exact pst, gst and city taxes - which by the way, this last one  I was not aware of, but any way...) and he said that that amount was wrong and that applied only for weekdays (I stayed there in a weekend), and also said that he charged the same amount to the rest of the people. We went on and on in the same discussion and something that did not make sense to me at all, was that he said that the person who took my reservation probably did not know this was a weekend! That drove me nuts because that's her job - to see the calendar, verify the date and provide details based on that. Anyway, after 3 or 4 minutes discussing he suddenly just decided to charge the correct amount but the most surprinsingly thing is that just before my eyes, he just grabbed another form from the drawer with my exact same information but with the proper charge. I was so mad at that point that I just took it and accept it, but after thinking and thinking of that behaviour, I can't find a reason to justify that action. The guy was obvioulsy trying to get more money from me of what I was supposed to pay. \n\nAll I can say, is that even that the hotel - yes, was a very simple, small, old fashioned, you could probably still have a good time in Niagara in case you are short on budget, but with an attitud like that, then I just think that I'd rather to pay more money to ensure that my reservation is honoured. Sometimes the service can really make the difference when the facilities are not the best. Obviously this was not the case.\n\nGood luck when you look for a cheap hotel :)\n\nPS. By the way...

This charmingly retro little one story place is just a few minutes west of the crazy activity of the falls in the quiet neighbourhood of Chippewa. (The motel is across the street from a beautiful park right on the river. ) It's not fancy, but great value for your dollar. We booked the cheapest room at $69 (with Queen sized bed) on the Friday night of the labour day weekend (unheard of bargain in Niagara Falls!). \n\nI read about this place in the CAA\u002FAAA tour guide, and also I went on the Surfside's own website for more information and photos. The proprietors were so nice and friendly and our room was exactly what we expected.\n\nThe room had an airconditioner, (and a small screened window).The door was a glass patio type door, letting in lots of natural light -- beware that it automatically locks behind you, so keep you key on you when you step out! \nThe room was uncommonly large and very clean and Non Smoking (There may be smoking rooms, but if not,  there are patio tables and chairs just outside each room with an ashtray provided.) Our room even had a small fridge and an extra sink, counter and mirror outside the bathroom! There are plenty of dressers, a wardrobe, a TV, of course, 2 end tables as wells as a separate little table with two comfy chairs.  The linens weren't great, but they were clean -- bring beach towels with you for the pool. \n\nIt boasts an outdoor pool -- understand this --the pool is very, VERY small, but after riding bikes on a hot afternoon, it sure was refreshing! The \""sundeck\"" is just the cement around the pool, but there are comfortable chaise lounges there. I think there is a small gas BBQ for guests to use near the pool.\n\nRight across the road from the hotel is a huge, beautiful park  right on the river with playground equipment, a sprinkler thingy for kids to cool off, picnic tables and even some picnic shelters! There were also washrooms and vending machines.\nBEST OF ALL, is The Niagara Recreation Trail access from the park -- it's an amazing paved trail for bicycling and walking. It goes East from the hotel as far as Niagara-on-the-lake, and West as far as Fort Erie!  \n\nWe had a lovely dinner in Chippewa, at \""Betty's\"" (a 5 minute drive from the hotel).  It's a casual family-style restaurant with very reasonable prices. They specialize in fish, (famous for their fish & chips and do poached and grilled fish as well), but there were also other menu items. Their homemade pies are yummy! they closed at 8:30 pm on Friday, so go early!\n\nThere is no food service at the hotel, but there are some local bars and restaurants just around the corner, and yes, a Tim Horton's if you're addicted to coffee & donuts as well. You could get groceries in Chippewa without having to go through the crowds in Niagara.\n\nI would recommend this property if you want a safe, clean place to sleep in a pretty and quiet neighbourhood instead of on noisy, tacky \""hotel row\"" on Lundy's Lane.

The beds were very comfortable and I think it was probably the best sleep I've had in any hotel that I've stayed in ever. There's an air unit in the room which you can control your temperature because it was hot out this weekend that we went we kept the room very cold and it was very comfortable. Staff for very friendly and check in and check out were effortless. The distance was about a two-minute walk from Clifton Hill and you could also cut through the parking lot where the Raceway was to get to Clifton Hill quickly. Wego bus passes were not available there but you could buy them at a different hotel and there were bus stops nearby. Parking is $15 a night to park on site and if you want to walk a distance there's an overflow parking lot that has no cost but it is a fair distance away. Unfortunately we didn't have time to use the swimming pool but it was open. Many restaurants nearby and delivery come straight to the room to drop off food. \nWe were able to have an early check-in and checkout is at 11 a.m. Room service is not available for housekeeping because of the pandemic so you do have to take care of your own garbage and your room.

The lady who booked over the phone was nice enough and pleasant when we arrived. We were given a room on the second floor and when we went in it smelled awful...a combination of smoke and cleaning products. We asked for another room but one was no available. What she did through is bring an air purifier in the room which tells me they know the problem exsists and just use the purifier as a temp fix for some sort of ongoing issue. What I did not like was that they went back into the room to get the purifier without us being there.  Neither my friend or I are smokers and I could smell it in my hair and clothes after a night there. The sheets were not clean...you could tell as the white  fitted sheets had black dirt on them. The bathroom is basic and appeared to be clean although the shower curtain had mold on it. The hotel is used for long term guests so you do see people hanging outside smoking, partying etc. The breakfast is basic but hectic and not a very big area. The pool is good and clean.

The beds were comfortable and the blankets actually warm, rather than the typical thin hotel blankets. The bathroom was a bit old but clean. I really appreciated the minifridge and microwave, and there was both a heater and an AC unit so you could easily control the temperature.

No bathroom or change rooms in the pool area, but there was a shower to use (not private) The pool's temperature was a bit cool.  Though I understand that some guests may have tampered with the pool division float, I found the warnings that should the pool divided come lose or off while we were swimming than we'd be charged $150 and that we were being watched by security cameras a little bit off-putting.

After a long drive (about 8 hours) in a bus we were feeling as you can imagine very tired and exhausted. Although when we arrived at the hotel we thought we\u2018d explore some of the restaurants and landmarks near the hotel cause we might not come back here. But as we checked in and entered our room our beds were so messy, untidy and it looked like someone had jumped on them. It looked so disgusting.. also, we found our bathroom bin full of rubbish and what seemed like used women\u2019s sanitary items. It was like no one had come to clean the room. As we were leaving our room and we bumped into our tour guide and told him what our rooms were like and that were unsatisfied with the condition of it. And as he had a look of the room himself he helped us grab another room and expressed his most deepest sincerities. We were very happy with our tour guide and for his help. However, as we thought we were off the hook this time this room ended up being much much worse. After we came back from dinner we were shocked and appalled, as we came to discover dried urine on the toilet seat, several stains on one of our beds, half a box of eat doughnuts in our draw, a dirty bathroom mirror and dust and hairs on the bed... You would think anyone wouldn\u2019t want to live in these conditions right? Cause as we went to reception to obviously complain and try to grab another room the lady who served didn\u2019t seem very apologetic or responsive. Judging from her facial expressions, it had looked like she had dealt with this numerous times. After she had \u201Cdealt\u201D with our situation we were finally given an \u201Cupgrade\u201D to another room (even though it looked the floors hadn\u2019t been vacuumed.) It was around midnight when we finally slipped into bed and we had realised that this hotel had wasted a tremendous amount of our time as we wanted to explore some of the stores and landmarks nearby. I would definitely not recommend this hotel to ANYBODY. The service and the rooms were disgusting  and I\u2019m currently in the progress of hopefully getting a refund.

Carolyn and Gary are full of knowledge about the bus system, tourist spots, local eateries and more. You won\u2019t need a tour guide with local knowledge like they have. Their home is warm and inviting. At the end of the day the perfect place to relax is their porch which faces the river. The walk into town is beautiful. If you prefer not to walk there is a bus system (WeGo) that is only a hop, skip and a jump away. You will not find cleaner rooms, better breakfast, or friendlier hosts anywhere else in the area. We will recommend Park Place to our friends and family. And if we can ever escape our 4 kids again (god bless grandmas) we will be sure to return.

Lots of room and fitted with modern conveniences without losing the old-fashioned feel.  We especially liked the original wood floors.  A nice touch was the option of having breakfast delivered right to our kitchen table every morning.  The food was delicious.  Recommend trying the stuffed french toast and homemade blueberry muffins.  Carolyn and Gary gave us lots of privacy, but were readily available whenever we needed anything.  Carolyn virtually took care of it before we could finish asking!

This is a beautiful suite with large bathroom that includes both a walk-in shower and jacuzzi tub.  The room was very clean.  The bedroom has a very comfortable king-sized bed with TV and a small dining area if you choose to have breakfast in your room.  Yes....they will even bring you breakfast to your suite!  Speaking of breakfast....it is one of the highlights!!!   Not every B&B gives you a choice of menu items, but Gary and Carolyn do.  We had breakfast in the dining room two mornings and in our room the last morning.  Gary even had the dining room fireplace going for us one morning and Carolyn had arranged fresh flowers for the table.  During good weather, you can also eat on the front porch, but it was too windy and cool to eat outside while we were there.  The location of the house is perfect!  You are away from the busy tourist area of Niagara Falls, but close enough for convenience.  The WeGo bus stops approximately 1 1\u002F2 blocks from the home and will carry you to numerous places in the Falls area, only minutes away. You can also choose to drive your own vehicle or you can take a somewhat long walk to the Falls. The bus also runs north to Niagara on the Lake.  Gary is very informative about the bus route and where to get your day pass.  We love history and learned so much about the home......just beautiful.  We highly suggest a quiet late afternoon on the front porch to wind down from your busy day.  If you are interested in wine tours, Gary and Carolyn have great suggestions and also discount coupons.

I don\u2019t regret staying there because I was happy to have found a place but next time I\u2019ll plan better. It is VERY outdated, ridiculously so. Fixtures in the bathroom were old. In fact the room gave you the feeling that you were staying in a room in your 80 year old neighbors old house. I had the feeling that some people actually lived at this motel because there were chairs and grills outside of some of the rooms. \n\nThe gentleman at the check in area was kind and gave us some pointers on getting to the Falls, which was about a 10 minute walk down Clifton Hill. I did appreciate not having to drive there. \n\nIn a pinch this place was ok. The beds were comfortable.

We stayed here numerous times over the years. You would think with the amount of income they make, they could upgrade their rooms. Nope. Same old outdated rooms and even worse, bathrooms as in the past. So I have come to the conclusion, that it was acceptable in my younger days, because we came for the nightlife, the party atmosphere, the noise (now I have no idea why we didn't mind it) and the location. The location still stands as a 10\u002F10 for me. However that being said, DO NOT stay here if you have young children and even as a family, stay in their more modern and quieter hotel Travelodge next door that also has an outdoor pool. Our rooms have never had microwaves or fridges, or even an acceptable amount of electrical outlets for charging devices. The plus, is the balcony (other than the huge planters blocking our view). Karaoke starts early. At first, we don't mind the not so great sounding singers at times, but as the day passes, a headache begins, we became annoyed with the music and eachother and the only way to drown that is to drink. So if you come to Niagara to drink and party, this is the perfect spot for you. If you prefer quiet, peaceful and relaxed, you should find a hotel elsewhere.

Finding previous client food in the fridge, spilled coffee or coke on the bathroom door (inside) and having two TVs that had weak or no signal and not get addressed while we made the room available.

Although I\u2019m not sure what all of the extra fees were at checkout, $35 was the parking but $40 more in miscellaneous costs, probably was a WIFI fee as we both signed into it.

We had a fantastic view of Horseshoe Falls. It was kind of disheartening to not see both falls, but we took what we got. \nI loved the amount of natural sunlight that came into the small room. The room was clean and had a fridge. I\u2019m not sure that we ever actually closed the curtains. \nSide note: the hallways to the room was like a maze, I thought it was kind of fun lol. The room had a nice jacuzzi tub, but we didn\u2019t get the chance to try it out. \nFYI, don\u2019t forget to close the curtain while you\u2019re on the pot, you may have a lower building neighbor waving at you like I did \uD83D\uDE44\n\nThe reason I gave it 3 stars rather than 2, was because of one of the coupons we received for our flooded room.\nThey gave us a $100 off of a meal from Ruth Chris Steakhouse. I thought it was a slightly fancier Applebee\u2019s, but wow I was so wrong (read my review for that place lol). It was not a place we would have gone without the Tower Hotel providing the discount. \n\nSo bottom line, the service was unfortunate. Especially since we had planned to spend our Valentine\u2019s Day night romantically spending time cozy in the room with a view of the falls. \nThankfully it wasn\u2019t a once in a lifetime type trip for us because I would have been quite upset otherwise. \nThe room was nice, but not what we paid for. \nI\u2019d stay again, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to convince my bf.

It\u2019s 20 bucks across the road but they tell you that you cannot park there. (You can). \n\nMy wife had an important appointment in buffalo the next morning and we stayed in the falls to relax her and keep things smooth. The shuttle sounded like a joke so I agreed to pay the 50 dollars for vallet. They told me to call from my room 15 minutes before we needed to go and it would be ready to rock. In the morning when we called they said no, you have to head down to the front desk and request the vallet and wait in the lobby for it to return. Never in my life have I heard of that. \n\nSo I went down, requested the vallet, the guy radios to the vallet three times before he gets an answer(probably sleeping, it was 6:30am), doesn\u2019t know where my truck is and then finds out that they didn\u2019t put me under vallet and that my keys were left at the lobby and I had to take a shuttle to the parking lot.

The room was located on the 30th floor Rm # 3001 as a surprise gift for my husband\u2019s 30th birthday Lol. If anyone's looking for a short stay give this a try but would recommend do your own research before booking to make sure this hotel meets your expectations. So, the room we got had a very nice King size comfy bed with an amazing falls view. Drawback here was you can\u2019t fully enjoy the view because of the rooms of embassy suites that is facing the falls too you can literally see people in the embassy suites. God knows who's watching whom. But anyways we did enjoy the view we got no regrets. There are small things to consider before booking as there are not a lot of amenities in the room. We did get a fridge but I guess may be because I asked for it and so they would have arranged. There is a small table and a chair. TV, WIFI, Iron box, few hangers, alarm clock, ice bucket, enough toiletries for two. One thing that I liked was they do keep 2 bottles of water. No microwave or coffee machine. They also give you a 20% coupon to their restaurant which we didn't bother using. My husband did point out couple things about the room like the shower curtain rod being rusted, walls being stained by previous guests and also a big spider by the door. I do have pictures of it, but I don't want to post and freak people out. I guess it depends on us how we respect someone else's property by leaving the room in a good state. I bet nobody will do this to their own house. Free Parking as a complimentary for my husband\u2019s birthday could have made us feel a little better. They say it\u2019s a valet parking we paid $25 but then we had to park off the property and no valet parking due to Covid-19 which is understandable but at least could have brought the parking price down if you\u2019re not providing valet service.

We asked for a spot, and the desk clerk acted like she was from another planet, saying to wait for one to become available!

The bed lining was ripped in some parts. There were massive stains in the carpet, to the point that I began to think it was just a pattern. The walls had spider webs EVERYWHERE. The bathroom was as disgusting or more as the one from the movie Trainspotting (excellent flick). The couch appeared to have been picked up from whatever garage sale was nearby. Have I missed anything? I did mention the odour right? Ohhh right, the advertised King size bed was really a double, which when asked at the reception was told it was actually a Queen. We have a Queen at home, that was NOT it. At all this, we were getting charged $100 a night? So we inmediatly decided to leave this horror and were told to check out another one from the same company called the Fallsview Motel... Which was equally as bad. After that debacle (along with trying to get our money back from Expedia.ca) we went over to the Best Western which even thoughit was 199, it was worth every penny. Doesn't matter that for that one night we ended p paying at the 2 hotels (we're still in dispute with Expedia) . There was simply no way in hell that we'd stay in this hell hole. DO NOT STAY HERE!!!

I enjoy playing craps at the Fallsview Casino which is just across the street from this Quality Hotel. \n\nI am a Choice Hotels member and reserved my room in advance of this trip. As I was enroute to the hotel I received a call from front desk clerk Henry who notified me that my credit card was rejected. I received a replacement credit card a few days prior to my trip and had yet to update my Choice Hotels account. His call was much appreciated.  \n\nMy stay was during the off-season. The rate was very reasonable. One should READ the \""Additional Fixed Charges\"" that are clearly noted on the \""Rate Detail Info\"" page when booking a room using the hotel's website. Be aware of additional fees & taxes: destination marketing fee, harmonized sales tax, transient accommodation tax, and resort fee, in addition to the hotel room charge. Although these additional charges are clearly disclosed on the hotel website, I'm surprised at the number of people who complain about these fees (which are standard across hotels in this area) claiming they were blindsided by them.  \n\nCheck-in was a snap, thanks again to Henry. I stayed on floor 5, room 505, of the main building. Yes, the elevator isn't the most modern, the warmest, or the fastest. It did however, go up and down. As a rule, I limit my elevator usage and use stairs whenever possible. I suggest you do the same, should your physical condition warrant.  Your heart will thank you later. The balcony had a view to the west, overlooking the parking lot below, Murray St. and the Murray St.- Fallsview Blvd. intersection (not a bad view). I didn't request a view of the falls as I've seen them before. :)\n\nThe weather was bitter cold during my 2 night stay. The room was toasty. Hot and cold water ran freely. There was a working refrigerator in my room. The bed was comfortable and the sheets crisp and clean. The hallway was quiet. I slept well. Internet and TV worked as expected. The floors were clean, including the carpet in the hallway.  All in all, for less than $160 US for 2 nights, this was a \""Very Good\"" value.  \n\nI'm not a big breakfast eater so the cereal, yogurt, and juice that was available met my needs. I believe waffles were available and possibly eggs also, but I'm unsure. I'm not a swimmer hence didn't use the pool. The property lacks a \""fitness center.\"" A treadmill would be a nice touch, as I am a runner and the weather didn't permit an outdoor run. \n\nAgain, this property lived up to its Very Good rating during my January, 2020 visit.",4,positive,"January 15, 2020",5305 Murray Street,Niagara Falls,Ontario,L2G 2J3

I understand they can not have their regular breakfast available but what was offered was kind of pathetic.  It was an apple (red delicious which are a terrible eating apple), a muffin (that was really dry) and an apple juice box.  We ended up eating elsewhere which kind of ticked us off because we thought there might at least be yogurt or a bit more variety of fruit or perhaps at least fresh muffins.\n\nOverall I likely will not stay here again but it served the purpose for the three nights we were there.

We are Choice Privileges Gold Members and stay at many Choice Hotels in various states during the year.  We chose this Quality Inn for its location, affordable rates, and a room type that met our needs.\n\nThe positives about this property are its location and friendly staff.  You are in complete walking distance of anything you want to do in the area and the staff running the property was all very friendly, courteous, and helpful to us during our stay.\n\nThe hotel is currently being renovated.  Due to that issue, the large, four\u2013story main building is completely closed with the exception of the front desk, restroom facilities, and the breakfast room.  All guests stay in a two\u2013story, outside corridor, old building across the parking lot from the main building.  This was not advertised, known, or otherwise communicated by the property until arrival.  Several of our concerns were:\n\n\u2022\tMain room door was dented, patched, scraped, and looked very \nunsightly.\n\u2022\tA refrigerator was provided but not a microwave \u2013 one is available for use in the lobby area.\n\u2022\tSome light bulbs in the room were burned out.\n\u2022\tThe room walls were dirty, patched, dented, or otherwise damaged.\n\u2022\tThe electronic keycard system to access the room failed for multiple families and maintenance had to come and get them into their rooms at night.\n\u2022\tThere was no drain plug for the tub \u2013 just an open hole.\n\u2022\tNo toilet paper roll mount.\n\u2022\tDamaged, repaired, patched, moldy trim and tile in the restroom.\n\u2022\tSubpar water pressure for the shower and toilet.\n\u2022\tA\u002FC unit was smelly and provided very basic cooling but was not as expected.\n\u2022\tInternet was intermittent and\u002For kept dropping depending on the time of day.\n\u2022\tThe draperies in the room were just disgusting.  There is no other appropriate word to describe them.\n\u2022\tParking is $15.00 per day (even if you are a guest) and the hotel parking lot serves as public parking as well so when we would come back at night there were no spots available even though we were the guests.  This was a major complaint by many guests we happen to speak with\u2026 this must change!  The fee is ridiculous but then to offer spaces to the public in lieu of having your guests having a place to  park is terrible.\n\u2022\tBreakfast was very basic.  They had cereal, but no milk one morning.  Breakfast meats are hit and miss. No fruit available.  Definitely not up to the standards at other Quality properties.\n\u2022\tSwimming pool is part of the renovation project in the main building so it is closed.  We have attached pictures.  The entire pool area is being utilized for a storage center for all mattresses and other room items.  The pool is not being renovated.  Based on what we saw, it may be another 6\u201312 months before that pool area is even remotely functioning again.   However, they are actively promoting the pool on their electronic sign as an amenity even though it has not been available for months.\n\nWe do not know who is coordinating this construction project but it is sad.  To close a whole building down for months and months and have your guests stay in such a dumpy property without communicating this issue to them properly is borderline deception.  The parking situation must be addressed.  This property should absolutely not be used as public parking and should be free or included in the rate a guest pays.  Not acceptable!\n\nThe location is good.  The rates are reasonable.  The staff is friendly & helpful.  As for anything else about our stay, we cannot recommend.  Why they do not just renovate a floor at a time is beyond us.  If you cannot do that, then close the entire property until the construction is done.  Instead they choose to anger and frustrate guests staying there during this project and suffer with bad reviews because of improperly communicating the extent of the construction project and the relocation of the rooms they do have available.  Better planning & communicating to guests could have saved the property a lot of heartache.\n\nQuality Inn & Suites?  Nope.  No suites to speak of\u2026   at least not until the ridiculous construction project is done.  The pictures online advertising the property are not accurate or honest.  In our opinion and experience with Choice Hotels, this property would be more appropriately branded as an Econo Lodge given its current state.

With traffic jams everywhere and parking near the falls costing $25 a day, it is useful to have lodging from which you can walk to where you can see the falls \u2013 which, after all, IS the reason tourists come here (isn\u2019t it?). I was thus surprised to see a good price for a place relatively close to the falls, at a chain that I have enjoyed several times. I might have guessed that it would be only a mediocre stay \u2013 not a bad one, mind you, just not a great one.\n\nWhen the check-in clerk noted that I am a Gold Member of ChoiceHotels (ie, I stay at this group a LOT), he immediately offered to give me a different room from the one I had reserved. He stately honestly that the room I had reserved was in need of renovation, but offered to give me a renovated room for the same price. I looked at both rooms and agreed to take his offer; the older room looked like it hadn\u2019t been upgraded in fifty years. Although the room we stayed in had, indeed, gotten some renovations (particularly the bathroom), this place as a whole is still in need of work in order to reach the level I expect from Quality Inns.\n\nOur room had a shower, AC, phone, radio-alarm, iron & board, small fridge, coffee maker, hair dryer, and TV with a few dozen channels. It was clean, quiet, and adequately maintained (note photos). Staff was polite and professional. Parking was $15 a day, including overnight, which is actually a good price compared to places that charge about that much to park just for the day. Free amenities include wifi (quite good), a PC & printer in the lobby, and a hot breakfast in a crowded area.\n\nWe were bemused by our room layout. Although there was a couch and sitting chair, there was no work-style chair at the desk. Sitting at the desk would have put you right in front of the TV, meaning your room-mate could not watch TV if you were working at the desk. And the couch was right in front of the \u201Ffireplace,\u201D for reasons I couldn\u2019t begin to fathom. The AC unit was loose, and had its cord connected to a short extension cord instead of just being plugged in \u2013 it worked fine, however. And several places were in need of touch-up painting.\n\nNo surprise that there are countless restaurants and shops within walking distance of this place. Indeed, this motel is connected to a Hooters restaurant, at which you can get a discount with your room key -- and the Hooters is portraying itself as a place to take your kids.\n\nI\u2019ve generally associated Quality Inns with, well, quality. This place was a bit of a disappointment, however. Still, if you can handle a less than stellar place that has a good price and location, then this motel would make a good choice.",4,positive,"August 13, 2019",5234 Ferry St,Niagara Falls,Ontario,L2G 1R5

The location is perfect, just a 2 minute walk to the hill, so you're nice and close without hearing any loud attractions or having bright lights keeping you awake. The pool hours are great as well.\n\nThe Not So-Greats:\nRooms are very outdated and rather crammed. Wall paper needs to be replaced.\nThe price in my confirmation email did not match at Check Out due to extra fees that are not included when booking. The pool area is falling apart a bit, the hot tub was not operational leaving a lot of broken tile pieces exposed. The price was quite outrageous for the stay, it was approximately $600 for 3 nights.

It was alright but nothing special and I feel didn\u2019t warrant the high price.\n\nMy husband and I booked the King Jacuzzi room with the Fallsview as a late Valentine\u2019s celebration. It was pricey (almost $200 for the casino package) but we thought it would be worth it for a special treat.\n\nThe room was quite dated and overall our experience was disappointing.\n\nPros:\n- friendly staff with smooth checkin and out\n- appreciated the casino coupons. I won $60 so am happy with that.\n- decent size room\n- on demand movies, though the tv was smaller and not great quality picture.\n- very comfy king size bed. I slept so deeply and awoke refreshed. \n- pool was a decent size and perfect temperature\n- I didn\u2019t use it but I did check out the gym. It was a small but looked well equipped with new equipment and weights.\n\nCons:\n- totally deceiving photos on their website!!! They make the \u201CFallsview\u201D appear much closer than it actually is. The windows are small. What you actually see is the street, some buildings, another street and then the Falls way on the other side of that. Much farther away than the photos lead you to believe and really not impressive at all. They obviously really cropped the photos to make your view seem much closer than it actually is. Please see my room view photo for comparison. My husband and I would normally stay somewhere that offered more of a deal but we thought it would be fun to treat ourselves to a \u201Cfancy\u201D hotel with a great view. This wasn\u2019t it. We stayed before at I think the Embassy which has very impressive views of the Falls, like they were right there in front of you. This was very disappointing and definitely not worth the extra price. To call this an \u201Camazing fallsview\u201D is false advertising.\n- the bathroom was freezing cold and small\n- no extra blankets for the bed! I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever stayed anywhere that doesn\u2019t have an extra blanket in the closet, especially when you\u2019re spending this much. The bed just had a thin cotton \u201Cblanket\u201D and no duvet or comforter.\n- noisy! I guess because it\u2019s an older hotel, there is poor sound proofing. We were on the 8th floor but could hear noise from the street, the hallways, and weird hissing\u002Frattling noise whenever someone used water in an adjacent room. \n- the room looked like it\u2019s been a very long time since there have been any updates. Very old fashioned styling with all browns and greens and wallpaper. I\u2019m sure this was a nice room at one time.\n- you get \u201Cfree\u201D bottles of water, coffee\u002Ftea and internet but then they charge  $15 on your bill as an additional fee so you\u2019re really paying for these \u201C complimentary extras\u201D\n- the hot tub in the pool area was not hot enough and the jets were weak. The pool area in particular looked very neglected and sad. Surrounding the pool is a perimeter of rocks and it looked very junky with tons of blue boxes laying around, a ladder laying on the ground, and just generally very messy. Not a luxury feel whatsoever.\n- far from the Fallsview (newer) casino. It\u2019s right beside the older casino which is not as nice. It\u2019s a 20 minute walk from the newer casino. That would be fine in the summer but more of a hike than we planned when it was cold out. \n\nAll of these things would be fine in a cheaper hotel but not when you\u2019ve paid extra for an \u201Celegant\u201D stay in their most expensive room.\n\nI would not stay here again.

Hosts were great, it was very affordable and private however, there are few reasons why I may or may not consider staying there again.  We've stayed in the rooms on the main floor.  One of the rooms had windows that opened to the side of the house where the garbage was situated.  We went in the summer and I have a very sensitive nose, thus I couldn't sleep well because I was bothered by the stench, yet it was too hot to close the window.  Perhaps a fan would have helped air out the room, but then perhaps not?  My friend who was staying in the room next to ours slept very well and enjoyed his stay.  Which is why I would consider staying again and perhaps trying their top level room?  But it again depends on the location of the window and if it also opens to the side of the house.  Again, my nose is quite sensitive and I can smell anything and everything.  My advice to the hosts is to perhaps relocate their garbage area to a far corner of their property and ensure a tightly fit lid or container and not have bags beside the bin.  Especially in heat, garbage can permeate quicker.  \nI'm still deciding whether to return or not based on the fact that their breakfast was good, anything you wanted, they were very flexible and a lot of it that you'll definitely feel full.  The location is on a nice quiet street that's a short drive from the Casino's \u002F downtown.  The price is affordable and reasonable.  The hosts are welcoming, flexible to your arrival time, friendly yet not intrusive and perceptive to know if you are looking to talk or not.  \nIf I return to Niagara Falls, I would most likely search for another B&B and if I can't find something suitable, maybe I'd return and try their top level room.",3,negative,"April 6, 2013",4360 Simcoe St,Niagara Falls,Ontario,L2E 1T6

Also he tells you a certain price, then ups it $50 give or take and says it has to do with tax.. In front of our hotel room door there were two lovely broken plastic chairs for us to sit on. The door doesn't close completely so good luck with locking it. As soon as we walked in the room STUNK like vanilla air freshener had been sprayed to cover up the smell of the rotting corpse I was convinced was hidden in the plastic covered mattress. The furniture was outdated the curtains didn't match and the carpet felt wet.. So I immediately put my shoes back on and left them on. Everything was damp and everything was broken. The wall outlet buzzed if you put a plug into it. The drawers were lined in old filter paper from the 70's I'm convinced. The bed sheets were covered in pubic hair and blood, I actually ended up sleeping over the covers trying to avoid bed bugs and put my shirt over top of the pillow praying I wouldn't get lice. The towels weren't any better also covered in pubic hair accompanied by some poo stains. As soon as you trip into the first bathroom area, I say trip because there is a ledge about 2 inches off the ground that you can't see, you enter a room with dim lighting and a rusty, leaking sink that housed spiders in the drain. When you turned the tap on the lights would dim.. Then there was the actual bathroom, which was so small you basically had to stand in the shower to shut the door. the window was broken so they just decided to leave it open to try to hide it but there wasn't a screen. The shower curtain was mouldy, the shower head had so much grime in it only trickles of water came out. The bathtub and the toilet were covered in, you guessed it more pubes! The toilet wasn't flushed when we got in and there were dead bugs living in the corners of the bathroom. My company and I went out and when we came back the man running it actually followed us up the stairs, listened in at our doorway for a few seconds before my brother opened the door.

The hotel is pet friendly and allows large dogs which really helped us book a room for the night. There were a few things I did not enjoy while staying here; The hotel is in Niagara Falls but it is not walking distance from the falls, you definitely need to drive about 15 mins to get to the falls area. The hotel itself was a bit confusing to find the room as it has two buildings attached. The pet-friendly room is in the next building which is like a 1 min walk outdoor. Once outside, I noticed there is an indoor walkthrough attached to each building which is good for the winter although the staff did not mention that therefore we walked outside the main entrance to the next building. The parking was an extra $20 per night which should just be included during your stay. The pet fee was $40 per night which is quite normal and a decent price in my opinion. The room has a fridge which is great for storing refrigerated pet food though the temperature was way too high and nearly froze my dog's food. The rooms itself was clean but near the door, I saw a few ants and a small spider in the bathtub, which should have been cleaned prior to our visit. The pet-friendly room has hardwood floors which is good but my family stayed in a regular room which had carpet and it was not that clean. The staff was friendly but I did not see extra cleaning and sanitizing at all during my stay at this hotel. With this pandemic, we should see the staff clean the halls and sanitize doors etc. but no one was even seen once. The hotel gave us a safety kit which included 2 masks, hand sanitizer, and 2 sanitation wipes for the room which was good on their part. Breakfast is not included during your stay but they have a grill bar that serves breakfast. We waited an hour for our breakfast inside the restaurant and it was not packed at all! The prices and options are pretty good but our order came all wrong. Finally, the order was corrected and we were able to eat. The food was regular nothing great but the pancakes were delicious. They had Starbucks coffee but they were served in dark-colored coffee mugs which did not seem appealing. Even with a Starbucks in their building, it was not open, so if your interested in purchasing anything your out of luck this time. Since our breakfast was taking forever, I had to ask the front desk to expend our checkout time which they understood and allowed us to stay until 12 pm, which worked out.

Never again will I book Ramada. This place is posted online as a pet friendly hotel - it\u2019s not when they are charging you $40 A NIGHT to keep you dog with you. The manager of this place had to explain to me that they normally keep pets in the second building of the hotel, and because it\u2019s closed due to Covid, they had to put us in this building. That\u2019s not pet friendly then is it? Why market pet friendly when you\u2019re going to charge people out the ass for it. The price for my husband and I was $45 a night due to booking through my work discount. Having my dog in a \u201Cpet friendly\u201D hotel has cost me double. When I booked this place, there was no posted rate on the website page about parking being $20 a night either. Wifi doesn\u2019t work. Hasn\u2019t worked once since being here and I\u2019m so disappointed by this place I\u2019m writing this review using my own data. I called 4 times to get it fixed and even the front desk was confused as to why none of our devices weren\u2019t working. They had us in our first room, the lights were not working and we had to switch rooms. Not the worst thing but annoying when you travel so far to get here, you should just expect the lights to work. I also booked this place due to the higher stars and the name brand itself, don\u2019t be fooled. It\u2019s also 15 minute drive away from the falls. I am checking out early and I\u2019m going to the Motel 6 that\u2019s a 2 minute drive and a 10 minute walk from the falls. They advertise as pet friendly and they keep pets free! As well as only charge parking $10 a night. Go to the motel 6 instead so you not charged double your stay. The motel 6 also doesn\u2019t charge you a resort fee of $15 a night! Yup. Ramada charges you not only for your room, but for you to use the pool and the conference room (which we didn\u2019t even use) and this resort fee came after I booked the hotel. It was not up front, my email came afterwards with all of the extra charges including parking. I called the customer care line, was hung up on 3 times before I was actually able to speak with someone. Finally when I get through, they take your details, give you a reference number and say someone will be with you in a week! I work for a bank, I know what fees are and how they work. This is theft and it was not all upfront when booking even looking at their main website. The website and the customer call line says they have flexible policies but the manager said there was nothing he could do to make it right for me. Just said it is how it is. If I could give negative stars I would.

Add to that the 20$ for parking, the so-called facility fee, plus the 2$ mandatory city tax and you get a price increase of about 40% over the rate I booked. No option for the facility fee even though I said I wouldn't use it; the former DMF has now been enshrined as a city bylaw. Add to this the insult of a snotty service person, and you get a thoroughly unsavory experience. When I asked about the DMF I had the written bylaw rudely thrust in my face. When I asked about where in the reservation there was notice I'd pay for parking, and despite the fact I had it printed and saved to my phone, I got a shrug.

We walked first to a viewing spot of the American Falls and then we bought a 24 hour pass to the WEGO bus line. They have a stop about a block away from the Trillium, we used that as our major mode of transportation, Mary, the owner, let us keep our van there on the 2nd while we went sight seeing. The buses are all wheel chair accessible. Mary is very friendly and helpful; she gave us some tips on where to eat dinner and how to navigate around town and how to handle the fireworks that night at the falls; as it was a national holiday, we were leary of being in crowded places with a wheel chair.  Her advise was all spot on.  She also let us have the use of one of the other rooms that had not been rented out; which  was very nice; we shared the bathroom in the rose room with my mom so she didn't have to clean an extra bathroom. (when she offered this we had said no but then she explained she would still only have 2 beds to clean and an extra bathroom. We then said we would do it but wouldn't use the second bathroom.) Both rooms are neat and clean, not a speck of dust\u002Fdirt anywhere. The home is in a quiet, safe neighborhood.  The next morning she served us and the other couple that was staying there made to order omlets, toast, fresh fruit salad, and had wonderful homemade banana bread. She also had nutella, peanutbutter, honey, etc. offered. My mother who has an interest in china, had a nice conversation with Mary about her teapots that she had placed around the dining room.

We were open to a B&B since our room had A\u002FC, a private bathroom, free parking and the time for breakfast was flexible (a hot breakfast was served from 8-10 with coffee, tea, pastries and fruit available starting at 7:30). Also, if you're from the U.S., Ellis House was close enough to NY to pick up both AT&T and Verizon cell service in our room (The Retreat) and in the main house. From the moment we arrived, our hostess Vindya was friendly, accommodating and informative. Check in was easy and she helped us get the lay of the land so that we could take advantage of the local attractions. Our room was clean, comfortable  and we had everything we needed. Breakfast was really good and we enjoyed talking to other guests while dining. We walked to the Falls one day (maybe about 1.5 miles downhill to the Falls) and rode the WeGo bus the other days. Something we didn't realize on our first day riding the bus is that the first pick up isn't until a little after 10 AM. So if you want to ride the bus, be sure to take that into consideration when scheduling activities. The stop is about 4 blocks away from Ellis House and we felt safe walking from the bus stop to the B&B late at night. With the Adventure Pass, which is available at the Welcome Centers, the bus is free for 48 hours from the first time it's scanned on a bus. We definitely recommend taking advantage of that since parking is really expensive near the Falls and the buses run every ten minutes. Another plus regarding Ellis House's location is it was easy to get to Niagara on The Lake, which is a very quaint town with shops, restaurants and a plethora of wineries about a 25 minute drive away. We did a wine tour and the tour company picked us up and dropped us off right at Ellis House, which was very convenient.

Like other reviews mentioned, John and Chris are fabulous hosts as is their son.  They are most accommodating and are quick to help with suggestions when visiting the area.  They are an easy walk from Niagara Falls and the historic downtown, but also a short jaunt to the wine country outside of Niagara-on-the-Lake.  The location offers a less congested and quieter option to the commercial district.  Their recommendation for purchasing a cheap local bus ticket for 24 hours was most excellent as one wants to enjoy that fine wine and other libations without concern for a late night crawl home :-)  I stayed in the lighthouse room, which was complete with lovely amenities and all things lighthouse.  Although across the hall from another room hosting a family, my room was most quiet and relaxing.  Breakfast was yummy and a great send-off for a day's adventure.  The value was unbeatable.

When we checked in, for starters, our cards did not work for the room.   We left, came back a few hours later and that was fixed.  The condition of the room was horrible.  Ripped Wall Paper, light fixture coming off the walls, disgusting toilet set.  The room had a horrible smell of wet old carpet to it.   Every hour or so I was spraying an air freshener.....  Upon check-in, I had asked the lady to get the \""tourist tax\"" removed upon checkout.  She said sure just let us know.   When checking out, a different lady was there and pretty much told me its a resort fee and it has to be charged?  A resort fee?  This place is anything but a resort....  At that point, I was not even going to bother to argue for the 20 some odd dollars.  I handed in my cards and left.   Carpets are old, only one elevator working, the place is horribly run down.  I can't stress that enough.   It used to be a family favourite, but that was during the Hampton Days when things were \""kept up\""  Do yourself a favour and find a newer more modern hotel that cares about their guests.   And one last thing, the lady during checkout did not even ask me how my stay was, or how was the room.   The hallways had NO A\u002FC in them, and only a few lights in the parking lot worked.
